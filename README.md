# Identifying Conflicting Building Codes

## Problem Statement

Navigating the legal landscape of building and planning codes is challenging due to the presence of conflicts between various regulations. Discrepancies arise between state-level codes, such as California State Building Codes and regulations set by the California Public Utilities Commission, and local San Francisco building codes. This situation creates confusion and can lead to legal and construction issues, which significantly delay the approval process of new construction plans in the city. (TODO: Determine what the use case to individuals filling out permits would be, as in how would they use these conflicts. Or determine whether or not the target audience should just be lawmakers, so they can create legislation with less internal conflicts).

Developing a solution that can automatically detect and highlight conflicts between these codes will streamline the construction and planning processes, promoting clarity and compliance.

## Focus Areas:

- Data Integration: Gather data from sources such as California State Building Code, California Department of General Services, and California Public Utilities Commission.
- Conflict Detection: Design an algorithm or AI system to identify inconsistencies and conflicts between state and local building codes.
- User-Friendly Output: Present conflicts in an easily understandable format for architects, builders, and legal experts.

## Key Stakeholders:

Architects and Builders
Legal Professionals
Local Government Officials

## Expected Outcomes:

- Improved Construction Compliance: Minimize legal disputes and construction delays by proactively identifying conflicts between codes.
- Streamlined Planning: Enable smoother planning processes by resolving regulatory contradictions.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Facilitate better understanding and communication between state and local regulatory bodies.
