SEC. 100. POLICY.
   It is found and declared that there exist in the City and County of San
Francisco substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units
whose physical conditions and characteristics render them unfit or unsafe for
human occupancy and habitation, and which conditions and characteristics are
such as to be detrimental to or jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of
their occupants and of the public.
   It is further found and declared that there exist in the City and County of
San Francisco residential buildings and dwelling units which were legally
constructed according to standards now generally recognized to be obsolete and
deficient in terms of current, modern housing standards for construction, use,
occupancy, light and ventilation and sanitary facilities. The continued
existence of these obsolete and deficient residential buildings and dwelling
units is detrimental to or jeopardizes the health, safety and welfare of their
occupants and of the public.
   It is further found and declared that the existence of such substandard
buildings by reason of being unsanitary, obsolete and deficient as dwelling
units threatens the physical, social and economic stability of sound
residential buildings and areas, and of their supporting neighborhood
facilities and institutions; necessitates disproportionate expenditures of
public funds for remedial action; impairs the efficient and economical exercise
of governmental powers and functions; and destroys the amenity of residential
areas and neighborhoods and of the community as a whole.
   For these reasons it is hereby declared to be the policy of the City and
County of San Francisco:
   (1)   That it is in the public interest of the people of San Francisco to
protect and promote the existence of sound and wholesome residential buildings,
dwelling units and neighborhoods by the adoption and enforcement of such
standards, regulations and procedures as will remedy the existence or prevent
the development or creation of dangerous, substandard, unsanitary or obsolete
and deficient residential buildings and dwelling units.
   (2)   That the adoption and enforcement of a Housing Code is a necessary
municipal governmental function in the interest of health, safety and welfare
of the people of San Francisco.
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 101. TITLE.
   This Code, known as the 2007 Housing Code, is a portion of the San Francisco
Municipal Code, and is referred to herein as "this Code."
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 102. PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Code is to provide for the maintenance of the minimum
requirements for the protection of life, limb, health, property, safety and
welfare of the general public and the owners and occupants of residential
buildings in San Francisco. In case of any conflict between the provisions of
this Code and other provisions of the Municipal Code, the most restrictive
shall govern except as set forth in Section
104(a).
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 103. SCOPE.
   The provisions of this Code shall apply to all existing buildings or
portions thereof used, designed or intended for residential use, except that
said provisions shall apply to homeless shelters only to the extent provided by
subsection (7) below. Buildings in existence at the time of the passage of this
Code may have their existing use or occupancy continued, if such use or
occupancy was legal at the time of the passage of this Code, provided the
building construction met the code requirements in effect at the time of
construction and alteration, and such continued use is not dangerous to life
and is not substandard, or that such use or occupancy does not now need
additional Code requirements applied by adoption of a retroactive provision
such as those referenced in Section
206 of this Code. All buildings and structures, both existing and new, and all
parts thereof, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All
devices or safeguards which are required by this Code shall be maintained in
conformance with the Code edition under which installed, unless otherwise
required by the
Building Code or other adopted ordinance applied retroactively. The owner or
the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of the
buildings and structures.
   Wherever used in this Code, the terms "residential use," "dwelling," "hotel"
and "apartment house" shall be considered to include the additional terms as
follows:
   "Dwelling" shall include lodging houses, nursing homes for not more than
five persons, and the other occupancies referred to in Section 310 of the
Building Code.
   "Apartment house" or "hotel" shall include dormitories designed for more
than five persons and occupancies referred to in Section 310 of the
Building Code. Such occupancies in existing buildings may be continued except
when such structures are found to be substandard as defined in this Code.
      (1)   Any building or structure not erected as an apartment house, hotel
or dwelling, which is converted to or altered for such use, shall conform to
all the provisions of the
Building Code for such use.
      (2)   In any building erected as a combined apartment house and hotel, or
any building altered or converted into a combined apartment house and hotel,
every portion thereof used for apartment house purposes, including each
apartment, shall comply with all apartment house requirements of the
Building Code or this Code; and every portion thereof used for hotel purposes,
including each guest room, guest room suite, and dormitory shall comply with
all the hotel requirements of the
Building Code or this Code.
      (3)   It is unlawful to increase the percentage of the lot occupied or in
any manner, whether by sale, conveyance or otherwise, to diminish the required
size of yards, courts, passageways, shafts, windows or skylights, or to remove
any required sanitary facility, fire protection equipment, device, safeguard,
installation, stairway or fire escape, or to obstruct the egress from any
building or from the hallways, passageways or stairways.
      (4)   If it is reconstructed, any building which has been damaged by fire
or the elements shall conform to all applicable provisions of the
Building Code.
      (5)   Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Code, all
applicable provisions of the San Francisco Municipal Code shall be complied
with in the construction, alteration or repair of residential buildings.
      (6)   It is further provided that the Director of the Department of
Building Inspection may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations supplemental
to this Code and not in conflict therewith, provided they are the most
generally accepted or approved methods and practices for public welfare and
safety of life and property. Such rules and regulations shall be subject to
reexamination and change if at any time such rules and regulations are found by
any enforcement agency not to be in conformance with the intent or requirements
of the Municipal Code.
      (7)   Notwithstanding Section
206 or any other provision of this Code, use of any building or portion thereof
by an organization exempt from federal income tax under Internal Revenue Code
Sections 501(c)(3) or 501(d), as approved by an authorized government agency,
to shelter otherwise homeless persons, or construction, alteration or repair of
any building to initiate, expand or continue such a shelter, shall be subject
to only those provisions of this Code which are determined by the Director of
the Department of Building Inspection pursuant to an administrative bulletin to
be published by him, after consultation with the Building Inspection Commission
and the Fire Department, to be necessary or appropriate to prevent the building
from being or becoming a nuisance as defined in this Code. Any provision waived
by said bulletin shall be applied when homeless shelter use ceases, and may be
applied when homeless shelter use is reduced.
      (8)   Rooming houses, congregate residences or lodging houses shall
comply with all requirements of this Code for dwellings.

      (2)   Any person or entity who violates, disobeys, omits, fails, neglects
or refuses to comply with any provision of this Code, or any notice or order of
the Director of the Department of Building Inspection made pursuant to this
Code which is not chargeable under Section
204(a)(1) may be charged with an infraction, and a citation may be issued

all persons authorized by the Housing Inspection Division of the Department of
Building Inspection to conduct on-site inspections shall have the power,
authority and immunity of a public officer and employee as set forth in
California Penal Code Section 836.5, to make arrests without a warrant whenever
such employees have reasonable cause to believe that a violation of this Code
has taken place in their presence; provided, however, that no such arrest shall
be made until the time period for compliance provided in the initial notice of
violation has expired. In any case in which a person is arrested pursuant to
this authority and the person arrested does not demand to be taken before a
magistrate, the public officer or employee making the arrest shall prepare a
written notice to appear and shall release the person on their promise to
appear as prescribed by Chapter 5C (commencing with Section 853.6) of the

provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, with a notice or order by the
Director of the Department of Building Inspection setting forth the nature of
the violation of this Code, demanding correction of such violation, and
specifying the time within which such violation must be corrected, shall be
presumed, in civil proceedings, to have failed to comply with said notice or
order at and after the time given in said notice or order for correction of
such violation has expired without correction of said violation.
      (2)   Any person or entity violating this Code shall be liable for a
civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each day such violation is committed or
permitted to continue, which penalty shall be assessed and recovered in a civil
action brought in the name of the people of the City and County of San
Francisco by the City Attorney in any court of competent jurisdiction. There
shall be no more than one violation per building per day. In assessing the
amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider any one or more of the
relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, but not
limited to, the following: the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the
number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time
over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's
misconduct, and the defendant's asset's, liabilities and net worth. Any penalty
assessed and recovered in an action brought pursuant to this paragraph shall be
paid to the City Treasurer and credited to the Department of Building
Inspection's Special Fund.

general damages, or three times the amount of one month's rent that the
landlord charges for the unit in question. The court may award in addition
thereto, not less than $200 but not more than $400, together with punitive
damages. The interested party instituting a civil proceeding, or the City suing
to enforce Section
503(d), if prevailing parties, shall be entitled to the costs of enforcing
Section
503(d), including reasonable attorney's fees, pursuant to a court order.
      (3)   Any person who commits, or proposes to commit, an action in
violation of Section
503(d) may be enjoined therefrom by any court of competent jurisdiction.

person, by the District Attorney, by the City Attorney, or be any interested

      (5)   Any action brought under this subsection shall be filed within one
year of the alleged violation.
   (e)   Special Assessment Lien to Recover Fees or Costs. Any person, the
owner or their authorized agent, who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or
refuses to comply with, or who resists or opposes the execution of any order of

Building Inspection made pursuant to this Code, will be subject to the
placement of a special assessment lien in the amount of the fee owed or

Unit Residential Buildings. The Director of the Department of Building
Inspection is expressly authorized, under this subsection (f) and Sections
102A.16.1,
102A.16.1.1, and
102A.16.1.2 of the Building Code, to order the owner of a residential building
with three or more dwelling units to do one or more of the following to abate
or mitigate a fire hazard in the building that continues or recurs
notwithstanding the Department of Building Inspection’s prior issuance of
Notices of Violation and Administrative Orders:
      (1)   install a new fire sprinkler system;
      (2)   improve an existing fire sprinkler system or upgrade it to current
code requirements;
      (3)   install a new fire alarm and/or detection system; or

102A.7 of the Building Code for violation of the fire safety requirements
enforced by the Department of Building Inspection, a fire hazard (as defined in
Section
102A.1) continues to exist or recurs after abatement in a residential building
with three or more dwelling units; and
      (2)   while the cited code violations have not risen to the level of an
imminent hazard that requires issuance of an emergency order under Section
102A.16 of the Building Code, the violations are so extensive and of such a
nature (including but not limited to a nonworking fire alarm or sprinkler
system, a nonworking or chronically blocked fire escape, or locked or
chronically blocked exits or egress system) that the health and safety of the
residents and/or the general public is substantially endangered; and
      (3)   the property owner either has failed to abate or mitigate the
violations in a timely way in accordance with an order issued pursuant to
Section
102A.7 of the Building Code, or the violations recur after abatement.
   Each NOV or Administrative Order issued pursuant to Sections
102A.4 and
102A.7 of the Building Code that includes a fire safety violation shall provide
information about Building Code Section
102A.16.1 et seq. and the consequences for not abating fire safety violations
within the specified compliance period. In addition, prior to issuance of a
Fire Life Safety Notice and Order, the Building Official will send the warning
letter required by Building Code Section
102A.16.1.1.3.

SEC. 1201. TITLE.
   This Chapter shall be known as the Residential Energy Conservation
Ordinance.
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 1202. FINDINGS.
   The Board of Supervisors finds that:
   (a)   As a result of dependence upon conventional sources of energy, the
citizens of San Francisco will continue to experience rapid increases in the
cost of home energy and uncertainty as to the availability of future home
energy supplies.
   (b)   Significant opportunities exist for the citizens of San Francisco to
reduce energy consumption and become less dependent on the supply of
conventional energy for home use, through the installation of proven energy
conservation technologies in existing homes.
   (c)   Conservation of electricity and natural gas is essential to the
economic security and well-being of the people of San Francisco. Conservation
reduces overall demand for electricity and natural gas and therefor helps
reduce both the cost of energy and the rate of inflation. Benefits to the
community as a whole can be realized through reduced energy costs as a direct
result of conservation. These benefits include the lowering of housing costs,
stimulation of the local economy and creation of local jobs.
   (d)   While the increasing burden of utility costs has stimulated some
conservation investment in owner-occupied housing, little progress has been
made in improving energy efficiency in rental housing where owners do not pay
utility bills or where utility costs are included in the rent. Rental housing
comprises approximately two-thirds of all San Francisco housing.
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 1203. INTENT.
   It is the intent of this ordinance to contribute to the affordability of San
Francisco housing by promoting the wise and efficient use of energy through
cost-effective energy conservation standards for residential housing. It is
also the intent to overcome the current barriers to energy conservation in
rental housing and to reduce the impact of rising energy costs upon renters.
(Added by Ord. 399-89, App. 11/6/89; amended by Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord.
256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 1204. DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in Chapter 4 of this Code, for the
purposes of this ordinance the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings ascribed to them by this Section.
   (a)   Accessible. There is insufficient space in which to install the
specified energy conservation measure without significant alteration to the
structure.
   (b)   Accessible Attic Space. A space between a ceiling joist and roof
rafter where the vertical clear height from the top of the bottom chord of the
truss or ceiling joist to the underside of the roof sheathing at the roof ridge
is 18 inches or greater.
   (c)   California Plan for the Residential Conservation Service. The plan
adopted by the California State Energy resources Conservation and Development
Commission and filed with the U.S. Department of Energy on June 4, 1980, as
amended in January 1981, to meet the requirements of the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-619, Title II, Part 1).
   (d)   Complete Inspection. An inspection of the entire building done by the
Department of Building Inspection, including but not limited to: inspection of
all buildings with "R1," "R2," and "R3" occupancies as defined in the
Building Code pursuant to the Department's code enforcement program,
inspections for RAP loans and inspections for condominium conversion. An
inspection of only the public areas of a building does not constitute a
complete inspection.
   (e)   Cost-effective. That the contractor installed cost of any energy
conservation measure amortized over its useful life will be equal to or less
than the amount of money saved by consumers. In figuring the cost of an energy
conservation measure, the interest rate charged at the time of installation is
included.
   (f)   Escrow. As used herein, an escrow opened for the sale and purchase of
real residential property situated in the City and County of San Francisco.
   (g)   Energy Inspection. An inspection of a dwelling to determine which
energy conservation measures required under this ordinance are needed.
   (h)   Meter Conversion. The replacement of a master meter for electricity or
natural gas that serves more than one dwelling unit with individual meters that
serve each dwelling unit separately.
   (i)   Residential Building. Any privately owned single or multiple unit
dwelling, apartment house, condominium or other building used for "R1," "R2,"
or "R3" occupancy as defined in the
Building Code, excluding mobile homes, tourist hotels and motels.
      The residential portion of any residential building occupied as mixed
residential commercial use shall be considered a residential building within
the meaning of this chapter.
   (j)   R-value. The measure of the resistance of a material or building
component to the passage of heat. R-value is measured in the United States
customary units based upon square feet per hour per degree Fahrenheit divided
by Btu.
   (k)   Simple Economic Payback. The time needed to recover a conservation
investment on the basis of expected energy savings at current energy costs.
Simple economic payback is expressed in years, and is calculated by dividing
the estimated contractor-installed cost of a conservation measure by the
estimated dollar savings in the first year. Available tax credits and future
energy costs are not considered in the calculation.
   (l)   Transfer of Title. The conveyance of title to real property by one or
more persons as a result of sale or exchange, and including the execution of a
real property sales contract as defined in Section 2985 of the California Civil
Code and any change of ownership described in Subdivisions (c) and (h) of
Section 61 and Subdivision (c) of Section 64 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
   (m)   Unheated Areas. Any space exposed to ambient temperatures and not

SEC. 1212. REQUIRED ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES.
   The following energy conservation measures are required by this ordinance
for a residential building; provided, however, that if the owner proves,
pursuant to Section
1213, that the application of any energy conservation measure is not cost-
effective, that measure shall not be required.
   (a)   Building containing one or two dwelling units:
      (1)   Ceiling insulation to a minimum resistance level of R-19 over the
entire accessible attic space, provided that the existing ceiling insulation is
less than R-11. Before insulation is installed in a building not meeting this
standard, dropped spaces in attic floors, such as those above stairwells, shall
be sealed effectively to limit air infiltration. Installation of ceiling
insulation shall be required to conform to Section 719 of the
Building Code (Part II, Chapter I of the San Francisco Municipal Code).
      (2)   Weatherstripping of all doors, unless fire-rated, which lead to
unheated areas so as effectively and reliably to limit air infiltration. Doors
which cannot be weatherstripped without the replacement of the entire door or
doorframe are exempted from this requirement, unless the door is, for other
reasons, being repaired or replaced. The Director, in the guidelines, shall
specify those types of weatherstripping which are acceptable. In determining
which types of weatherstripping are acceptable, the Director shall consider,
among other matters, whether the weatherstripping meets the energy conservation
goals of this chapter and is cost-effective.
      (3)   An external water heater insulation blanket with a minimum
installed thermal resistance of R-6 on accessible water heaters. Installation
of external water heater insulation blankets shall meet any safety standards
set by the Director in the guidelines. In addition, the first four feet of
accessible hot water pipe leading from the heater shall be insulated to a
minimum resistance value of R-4. If foam is used to meet the R-4 standard, it
shall be a closed-cell type with a minimum wall thickness of three-quarters of
an inch.
      (4)   Caulking or sealing of all accessible major cracks and joints and
other openings in building exterior to reduce the loss of heated air or the
entry of outside air where feasible. Sealing of all accessible major openings
from the conditioned living space into unheated areas, including, but not
limited to, those found around plumbing vent pipes, electrical wiring, or
furnace flue pipes.
      (5)   Insulating all accessible supply and return heating and cooling
system ducts and plenums, which are located in unheated areas, to a minimum
resistance value of R-3 and sealing of all accessible duct and plenum joints
with pressure-sensitive tape or mastic.
   (b)   Building containing three or more dwelling units:
      (1)   All measures specified in Subsection (a) of this Section to the
extent applicable to the structure.
      (2)   Insulation of all accessible recirculating hot water, steam, or
steam condensate return piping throughout the structure to a minimum resistance
value of R-4 and all hot water storage tanks to a minimum resistance value of
R-6;
      (3)   Cleaning and tuning of boiler units to improve combustion
efficiency. Unless the boiler has been cleaned and tuned to ensure peak
combustion efficiency within the last five years and bears a tag so certifying
issued by a utility inspector or contractor regularly engaged in the field of
combustion efficiency, the boiler shall be cleaned and tested for combustion
efficiency and appropriate adjustments made to ensure peak combustion
efficiency by such a utility inspector or a contractor, who shall post a tag on
or near the boiler stating that a combustion efficiency test has been performed
and peak efficiency has been obtained through adjustment of the boiler's
controls and cleaning where needed, and the date the test was performed. In
addition, all boilers shall have the permit required by Chapter 1, Schedule 1-
M of the
Building Code;

SEC. 1218. INTERIM RULES.
   The Board of Supervisors finds that, currently, the information available as
to what additional energy-conservation measures are cost-effective in buildings
containing three or more dwelling units is incomplete. The Board of Supervisors
therefore authorizes the Director of the Department of Building Inspection to
adopt additional interim requirements for the installation of energy
conservation measures in residential buildings containing three or more
dwelling units in the following manner:
   (a)   The Director shall hold a public hearing at which testimony may be
given regarding the proposed interim requirement, prior to making a
determination. Notice of the hearing shall be sent as provided in Section
1217(a).
   (b)   The Director shall then adopt the proposed interim requirement if he
or she determines that the measure is cost-effective within the meaning of this
chapter and has a simple economic payback not exceeding five years, according
to the best information available. In developing such requirements, the
Director shall closely coordinate with ongoing utility programs and the
California Energy Commission.
   (c)   Within two years of adoption of any interim requirement, the Director
shall make a final determination as to whether the interim requirement is cost-
effective. If the Director determines that the interim requirement is not cost-
effective, then the requirement shall be canceled. If the Director determines
that the interim requirement is cost-effective, the Director shall present a
report on the interim requirement and proposed legislation to implement the
requirement to the Board of Supervisors prior to the expiration of the two-year
period. A public hearing shall be held on the proposed legislation and the
Board of Supervisors shall give notice in the same manner as provided in
Section
1217(a).
   (d)   The interim requirement shall remain in effect for 90 days beyond the
expiration of the two-year period. If the Board of Supervisors does not pass
the proposed legislation, the interim requirement will expire at the end of the
90-day period.

Ord. 161-92, App. 6/4/92; Ord. 256-07, App. 11/6/2007)
SEC. 12A02. FINDINGS.
   The Board of Supervisors finds that:
   (a)   Demand management measures, including feasible, cost effective
conservation, are a proven method of reducing water demand in urban areas.
   (b)   The application of proven water conservation measures will allow San
Francisco's economy and population to prosper without placing additional
demands on this valuable resource. Retrofitting water using devices such as
water efficient showerheads, faucet aerators, and water closets is one of the
most cost effective ways of reducing the City's potable water use.
   (c)   As a signatory to the California Urban Water Conservation Council
Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Urban Water Conservation, the San
Francisco Public Utilities Commission has agreed to actively promote the
replacement of high water volume water closets and showerheads, among other
water using devices, with more efficient models in San Francisco. The purpose
of this section is to reduce demand for potable water within the City and
County of San Francisco by establishing water efficiency standards for plumbing
fixtures. Water saved from these programs will help to ensure a reliable water
supply for customers both within and outside of San Francisco. This ordinance
is part of a continuing program to achieve the City's goal of reducing water
consumption in all residential, commercial, industrial and municipal buildings
in the City and County of San Francisco.

SEC. 12A03. INTENT.
   It is the intent of this ordinance to conserve existing water supplies by
reducing the overall demand for water in residential buildings by requiring the
installation of water conservation devices in all residential buildings, except
for tourist hotels and motels, upon the occurrence of specific events such as
when the building undergoes major improvements, when there is a meter
conversion, when there is a condominium conversion, and when there is a
transfer of title.

SEC. 12A10. REQUIRED WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.
   The following water conservation measures are required for residential
buildings as defined in Section
1204(i) of this Code, notwithstanding Section
1209 of this Code:
   (a)   Replace all showerheads having a maximum flow rate exceeding 2.5
gallons per minute, with showerheads not exceeding the maximum flow rate
established by the California Energy Commission, as set forth in the Appliance
Efficiency Regulations, California Code of Regulations, Title 20, Sections 1601
to 1608, as it may be amended. Showers shall have no more than one showerhead
per valve. For purposes of this subsection, the term "showerheads" includes
rain heads, rain tiles, or any other fitting that transmits water for purposes
of showering.
   (b)   Replace all faucets and faucet aerators having a maximum flow rate
exceeding 2.2 gallons per minute at a water pressure of 60 pounds per square
inch, with plumbing fittings not exceeding the maximum flow rate established by
the California Energy Commission, as set forth in the Appliance Efficiency
Regulations, California Code of Regulations, Title 20, Sections 1601 to 1608,
as it may be amended.
   (c)   Replace all water closets that have a rated water consumption
exceeding 1.6 gallons per flush with fixtures not exceeding the maximum rated
water consumption established in the San Francisco
Plumbing Code, Chapter 4, Section 402.2, as it may be amended. A seller of a
residential building may request an exemption from replacing a water closet in
the building if the replacement would detract from the historical integrity of
the building, as determined by the Director of the Department of Building
Inspection pursuant to the California Historical
Building Code and Section
12A11(b).
   (d)   Leak repair. All water leaks shall be located and repaired.
      (1)   For residential buildings with one and two units, water meter
registration shall be used to determine the existence of leaks. Compliance is
achieved if there is no meter movement for ten minutes while all household
fixtures are shut off.
      (2)   For residential buildings with three or more units, visual
inspection or water meter registration shall be used. If water meter
registration is used, compliance is achieved if there is no meter movement for
ten minutes while all household fixtures are shut off.
      (3)   In all residential buildings, all tank type water closets shall be
tested with leak detector tablets or dye to detect slow valve leaks, and all
flushometer type fixtures shall be visually checked for proper operation with
respect to timing and leaks.
   (e)   An exemption from the requirement for showerheads listed in Paragraph
(a) of this Section will be granted for a residence upon filing with the Public
Utilities Commission a letter from a licensed physician specifying a valid
medical reason on the part of the occupant of that residence for non-
compliance. An exemption under this Section shall continue in force until the
individual qualifying for the exemption no longer resides at the exempted
property, or until the medical condition qualifying for the exemption
terminates. Within one year following the departure of the individual
qualifying for the exemption from the exempted residence or termination of the
medical condition, all showerheads in the property shall be replaced in
compliance with Section
12A10(a). Upon transfer of title of any building subject to an exemption in
whole or in part under this Section, the provisions of Section
12A09 shall apply; however, proof of an exemption under this Section shall be
sufficient to show compliance with the requirements of this chapter as to low-
flow showerhead and/or an exempted residence within a multiple-family
residential building. An exemption for a single residence under this Section
shall not constitute an exemption for an entire multiple-family building
wherein the single residence is located.
