EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL BUILDINGS
(NOTE: The time limits for compliance with the provisions of Chapters 5B and 5C
have passed, but the ordinance and the time limits therein are still in
effect.)
SECTION 501B – PURPOSE
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of an
earthquake on existing unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings.
   The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for
structural seismic resistance for earthquake ground shaking and are established
primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury. Compliance with these
provisions will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury, or prevent
earthquake damage to rehabilitated structures, or protect against the release
of hazardous materials, or protect the function of essential facilities. These
provisions are not intended to mitigate ground failure hazards such as
liquefaction. The Community Safety Element of the General Plan of the City and
County of San Francisco should be consulted for areas most susceptible to
ground failure.
   Time limits are given for owners of unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings to submit an inventory of each building and an evaluation of the
degree of risk presented by the building. Priorities and time limits are
established for work to be completed.
   Requirements for seismic strengthening of unreinforced buildings are
contained in Chapter 5C.
SECTION 502B – SCOPE
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all existing buildings having
one or more bearing walls of unreinforced masonry as defined in Chapter 5C.
   EXCEPTIONS:
      1.   Buildings housing Group R Occupancies containing less than five
dwelling units or guest rooms and used solely for residential purposes.
      2.   Buildings accessory to and on the same lot as those described in
Exception 1.
      3.   Buildings which have been brought into full compliance with the
requirements of SFEBC Section
304.4 in effect on or after May 21, 1973.
   Compliance with the provisions of Chapters 5B and 5C does not supersede the
requirement for compliance with SFEBC Section
304.4 when otherwise required under SFEBC.
   A permit issued solely for compliance with any of the procedures of Chapters
5B and 5C of this code shall not be considered “substantial change” or
“structural work” as defined in SFEBC and compliance with SFEBC Section
304.4 will not be required.
SECTION 503B – DEFINITIONS
   For the purpose of Chapters 5B and 5C, certain terms are defined as follows:
   BOLTS-PLUS is the installation of shear and tension anchors at the roof and
floors and, when required, the bracing of the unreinforced masonry bearing
walls upon evaluation of the height-to-thickness ratio of these walls.
   POOR SOIL is all soil lying bayward of the line indicating the landward
limit of Bay Mud deposits as shown on the U.S. Geological Survey Map MF-1376,
title “Map Showing the 200-feet thickness contour of surficial deposits and the
landward limit of Bay Mud deposits of San Francisco, California,” by William B.
Joyner, 1982.
      EXCEPTION: A building need not be considered as being located on poor
soil when a subsurface exploration demonstrates that the soil is not underlain
by Bay Mud.
   UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL BUILDING is a building or structure having
at least one unreinforced masonry bearing wall.
SECTION 504B – COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
504B.1 General. The owner of each unreinforced masonry bearing wall building
within the scope of this chapter and Chapter 5C shall cause a structural
analysis to be made of the building by a registered civil or structural
engineer or licensed architect, and, if the building does not meet the minimum
standards specified in this code except as provided for in Chapters 5B and 5C,
the owner shall cause the building to be structurally altered to conform to
such standards or cause the building to be demolished pursuant to the program
implementation schedule set forth.
504B.2 Program Implementation. The requirements stated in Section 504B.1 above
shall be accomplished by submitting to the Building Official the following:
504B.2.1 Inventory form. The owner is required to submit to the Department,
within the time limits set forth in Table 5B-A, a properly completed inventory
form, signed and sealed by the owner’s civil or structural engineer or
architect. See San Francisco Building Code Section
110A, Table 1A-S for the applicable fee for the review of the inventory form. A
failure to respond within the time limits set forth in Table 5B-A is a
violation of this code.
504B.2.2 Risk assessment.
504B.2.2.1 General. When filling out the required information on the inventory
form, the owner’s architect or civil or structural engineer shall assign to the
building a relative level of risk depending upon the occupancy, soil conditions
at the site and the density of the population exposed.
504B.2.2.2 Level of risk assigned.
   1.   Level 1 buildings are buildings containing Groups A Occupancies with an
occupant load of 300 or more; or Group E Occupancies, and those buildings
greater than three stories in height which are located on poor soil.
   2.   Level 2 buildings are all non-Level 1 buildings which are located on
poor soil in the Downtown, North of Market/Civic Center, South of Market, South
of Market Residential and Chinatown Unreinforced Masonry Building Study Areas
as delineated on Figure 5B-1.
   3.   Level 3 buildings are buildings in the above areas which are not
located on poor soil and buildings located on poor soil outside the above
areas.
   4.   Level 4 buildings are all other unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings.
504B.2.3 Engineering reports. The owner shall engage a registered civil or
structural engineer or licensed architect to prepare an engineering report on
the building when:
   1.   An owner desires to demolish a qualified historical building or any
building containing a nonexempt Group R Occupancy rather than retrofit the
building, and a report is requested by the Building Official or the Building
Official of the Planning Department; or
   2.   The Bolts-plus level of strengthening is proposed; or
   3.   Strengthening to comply with the State Historical Building Code is
proposed; or
   4.   The owner believes the building complies with Chapters 5B and 5C
without any further alteration.
   The engineering report shall detail applicable retrofit requirements of the
least restrictive retrofit procedure for which the building qualifies. The
required retrofit measures shall be developed schematically, and a conceptual
construction cost estimate shall be included. If the Bolts-plus level of
strengthening defined above and described in Exception 1 to Section 509C.2 is
proposed, the necessary measures for compliance with the Special Procedure of
Section 511C shall also be designated, and a second cost estimate for this
option shall also be included in the report. If the engineering report
demonstrates that no deficiencies exist, and the report is approved by the
Department, the structure will be considered to conform to the requirements of
this chapter. Except as noted in 1. above, the report shall be submitted not
later than the date when the application for the building permit to either
strengthen or demolish the building would otherwise be required. The format and
content of the engineering report shall comply with the provisions of rules and
regulations to be issued by the Building Official pursuant to San Francisco
Building Code Section 104A.2.1 after consultation with the Seismic Safety
Retrofit Bond Program Board. See San Francisco Building Code Section

structural plans, specifications and calculations for the proposed mitigation
solution or a permit application to demolish the building. Time limits for
submission of the application and for permit processing and approval are
established in Table 5B-A.
504B.2.5 Commencement and completion of construction. Construction work shall
commence and a Certificate of Final Completion and Occupancy or final
inspection of work under a demolition permit shall be obtained within the time
limits set forth in Table 5B-A.
504B.2.6 Transfer of title. No transfer of title shall alter the time limits
for compliance set forth in Table 5B-A.
SECTION 505B – ADMINISTRATION
505B.1 Service of Notice. The ordinance enacting Chapters 5B and 5C that the
Building Official, not later than February 15, 1993, issue a notice to comply
with Section 504B.1 to the owner of each building known by the Department to be
within the scope of these chapters. The notice shall be accompanied by an
informational letter or brochure and a sample inventory form. The enacting
ordinance further provided that if, on or before February 15, 1993, an owner of
an unreinforced masonry bearing wall building had knowledge that he or she owns
such a building, then failure of the Building Official to issue a notice or
failure of the owner to receive such a notice would not relieve the owner of
the obligation to comply with the provisions of Chapters 5B and 5C within the
time limits set forth in Table 5B-A. An owner is presumed to have knowledge
that he or she owns an unreinforced masonry bearing wall building if the
building is on the inventory list of potential hazardous unreinforced masonry
bearing wall buildings required by Section 8877(a) of the California Government
Code.
   For buildings not known to the Department to be unreinforced masonry bearing
wall buildings and whose owners had no knowledge that the buildings are
unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings, the ordinance provided that the
time limits set forth in Table 5B-A shall commence upon the owners having
actual or constructive knowledge that their buildings are unreinforced masonry
bearing wall buildings.
   The time limits for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter 5B and
Chapter 5C have passed, however the compliance requirements are still in
effect. As provided above, for those buildings within the scope of Chapters 5B
and 5C not known to the Department to be unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings, and whose owners did not have actual or constructive knowledge that
their buildings are unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings, the time
limits set forth in Table 5B-B commences upon the owners having such actual or
constructive knowledge. Those owners who had actual knowledge on or before
February 15, 1993, or are presumed to have had such knowledge, are in violation
of this Code and are subject to enforcement action by the Department pursuant
to Section
102A of the Building Code.
505B.2 Appeal from Notice. The owner or the owner’s agent may appeal the
Building Official’s notice to the Board of Examiners in accordance with San
Francisco Building Code Section
105A.1.
505B.3 Processing and Recordation. Within 30 days of receipt of the inventory
form, the Building Official shall review it and either approve it as submitted
or reject it and return it for correction. Inventory forms returned for
correction shall be revised by the owner’s architect or engineer and returned
to the Department within 30 days of the date of the Department’s initial
rejection. The Building Official shall cause to be recorded with the Assessor-
Recorder’s Office a notice of the requirement for structural alteration or
demolition and the inventory form. The Building Official may cause such a
notice to be recorded upon expiration of the time limits for submittal of the
inventory form as stated in Table 5B-A.
505B.4 Enforcement. Whenever an inventory form has not been submitted or a
notice issued by the Building Official to structurally alter or demolish an
unreinforced masonry bearing wall building has not been complied with within
the time limits set forth in Table 5B-A, the Building Official shall have the
power to abate the building in accordance with San Francisco Building Code
Section
102A.
505B.5 Removal from Inventory. After all of the retrofit work required by this
chapter and Chapter 5C has been completed in any building to the satisfaction
of the Building Official and a Certificate of Final Completion and Occupancy
has been issued in accordance with San Francisco Building Code Section 109, or
after a final inspection of building demolition work has been made, or if the
Building Official finds that no retrofit work is required, the Building
Official shall remove that building from the inventory list of potentially
hazardous unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings required by Section 8877
(a) of the California Government Code. The Building Official shall thereupon
cause to be filed with the Assessor-Recorder’s Office a release of any notice
or Abatement Order recorded under Section 505B.3 or 505B.4. Additionally, the
Department shall furnish to each owner upon satisfactory completion of a
retrofit a sign, on a standard Department form, of the same size as that
required by California Government Code Section 8875.8, stating “This building
has been seismically retro-fitted to reduce the risk of death or injury in the
event of a major earthquake pursuant to Chapters 5B and 5C of the San Francisco
Existing Building Code.” The sign shall also indicate the retrofit procedure
used and shall bear the signature of the Building Official. The posting of the
sign shall be at the option of the owner.
505B.6 Voluntary Seismic Strengthening. The owner of a building that is exempt
from compliance with this chapter may voluntarily retrofit the building using
the procedures for seismic strengthening set forth in Chapter 5C.
505B.7 Application of Future Retrofitting Legislation. It is the present intent
of the Board of Supervisors that, absent a compelling public safety necessity,
buildings strengthened pursuant to Chapter 5C will not be subject to future
mandatory seismic retrofitting legislation adopted by the Board.
505B.8 Phased Strengthening. Other provisions of this code notwithstanding, an
unreinforced masonry bearing wall building may be strengthened in phases under
multiple alteration permits, provided:
   1.   A complete structural analysis accompanied by plans, specifications and
calculations for the proposed mitigation solution is submitted to the
Department with the first alteration permit application; and
   2.   A phasing program is submitted to and approved by the Department as
part of the review of the first alteration permit application; and
   3.   Each subsequent alteration permit application clearly indicates the
further work proposed and the work completed to date; and
   4.   The engineer or architect responsible for the structural design for the
strengthening program provides structural requirements observation in
accordance with San Francisco Building Code Section 1704.6; and
   5.   All of the required strengthening work is completed within the time
limits set forth in Table 5B-A.
SECTION 506B – EXISTING UTILITY, FIRE PROTECTION, LIFE-SAFETY SYSTEMS, HOMELESS
SHELTERS AND DISABLED ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
   This chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical, fire protection or life-safety systems which are in compliance with
the code in effect at the time of their construction or installation. The
application of SFEBC Section
501.7 relating to homeless shelters does not waive the requirement for
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 5C within the time
limits set forth in Table 5B-A. This section does not exempt any building from
compliance with the requirements of State or Federal disability access
regulations.
SECTION 507B – ENERGY CONSERVATION
   The provisions of California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6, the
California Energy Code, San Francisco Housing Code, Chapter 12 (the Residential
Energy Conservation Ordinance) are not applicable to buildings altered as
required by this chapter, unless the alteration work also constitutes a change
in use as defined in SFEBC Section
506, or increases the conditioned space or alters the lighting or mechanical
systems.

Alternative methods of testing may be approved by the Building Official for
masonry walls other than brick.
506C.3.3.2 Location of tests. The shear tests shall be taken at locations
representative of the mortar conditions throughout the entire building, taking
into account variations in workmanship at different building height levels,
variations in weathering of the exterior surfaces, and variations in the
condition of the interior surfaces due to deterioration caused by leaks and
condensation of water and/or by the deleterious effects of other substances
contained within the building. The exact test locations shall be determined at
the building site by the engineer or architect in responsible charge of the
structural design work. An accurate record of all such tests and their location
in the building shall be recorded, and these results shall be submitted to the
Department for approval as part of the structural analysis.
506C.3.3.3 Number of tests. The minimum number of tests per class shall be as
follows:
   1.   At each of both the first and top stories, not less than two tests per

forces.
   2.   At each of all other stories, not less than one test per wall or line
of wall elements providing a common line of resistance to lateral forces.
   3.   In any case, not less than one test per 1,500 square feet (139.355 m2)
of wall surface nor less than a total of eight tests.
506C.3.3.4 Minimum quality of mortar.
   1.   Mortar shear test values, vto, in psi shall be obtained for each in-
place shear test in accordance with the following equation:
      vto = (Vtest/Ab) - PD+L      (5C-1)
   2.   The mortar shear strength, vt, is the value in psi that, after
discarding the lowest 20 percent of the mortar shear test values, vto, is the
lowest of the remaining 80 percent of the mortar shear test values.
   3.   Any unreinforced masonry bearing wall with vto, or with mortar shear
strength, vt, less than 30 psi (206.84 kPa) shall be either removed, entirely
pointed and retested or have its structural function replaced and shall be
anchored to supporting elements in accordance with Section 506C.3.1 and Section
513C.8. When existing mortar in any wythe is pointed to increase its shear
strength and retested, the condition of the mortar in the adjacent bed joints
of the inner wythe or wythes and the opposite outer wythe shall be examined for
extent of deterioration. The shear strength of any wall class shall be no
greater than that of the weakest wythe of that class.
506C.3.3.5 Collar joints. The collar joints shall be inspected at the test
locations during each in-place shear test, and estimates of the percentage of
the surfaces of adjacent wythes which are covered with mortar shall be reported
along with the results of the in-place shear tests.
506C.3.3.6 Unreinforced masonry classes. All existing unreinforced masonry
shall be categorized into one or more classes based on quality of construction,
state of repair, deterioration and weathering. A class shall be characterized
by the allowable masonry shear stress determined in accordance with Section
508C.2. Classes shall be defined for whole walls, not for small areas of
masonry within a wall.
506C.3.3.7 Pointing. All deteriorated mortar joints in unreinforced masonry
bearing walls shall be pointed according to Section 516C. Nothing shall prevent
pointing of any deteriorated masonry wall joints before the tests are made,
except as required in Section 507C.1.

may be performed without special inspection.
507C.2 Masonry Shear Tests. In-place shear tests shall comply with Section
514C.
507C.3 Existing Wall Anchors. Existing wall anchors utilized as all or part of
the required tension anchors shall be tested in pullout according to Section
515C. The minimum number of anchors tested shall be four per floor, with two
tests at walls with joists framing into the wall and two tests at walls with
joists parallel to the wall, but not less than 10 percent of the total number
of existing tension anchors at each level.
507C.4 New Bolts. Twenty-five percent of all new embedded bolts resisting only
shear forces in unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested using a calibrated
torque wrench in accordance with Section 515C.
   EXCEPTION: The number of bolts tested may be reduced to 10 percent when
special inspection in accordance with Section 1704 is provided during
installation but in no case shall less than two bolts per 500 square feet
(46.45 m2) of wall or four bolts per wall be tested.
   All new embedded bolts resisting tension forces or a combination of tension
and shear forces shall be subject to periodic special inspection in accordance
with San Francisco Building Code Section 1704 prior to placement of the bolt
and grout or adhesive in the drilled hole. Five percent of all embedded bolts
resisting tension forces, but not less than two bolts, shall be subject to a
direct tension test and an additional 20 percent, but not less than three
bolts, shall be tested using a torque calibrated wrench. Testing shall be
performed in accordance with Section 515C.

third increase in allowable value of this code is not allowed for existing
tension anchors.
508C.7 Foundations. For existing foundations, new total dead loads may be
increased over existing dead load by 25 percent. New total dead load plus live
load plus seismic forces may be increased over existing dead load plus live
load by 50 percent.
   EXCEPTION: In buildings located in poor soil areas as defined in Chapter 5B,
any increase in dead load shall require an evaluation of the existing
foundation system.
   Higher values may be justified only in conjunction with a geotechnical
investigation. A foundation investigation shall be also submitted with the
building permit application when:
      1.   A building has an existing full or partial pile supported, or
similar foundation system or whenever the installation of such a system is
proposed as part of the strengthening.
      2.   Whenever there is evidence of significant distress attributable to
foundation or geotechnical conditions.
      3.   An investigation is required by San Francisco Building Code Section
1803 or 1804.

permitted by the exception to Section 503B.
SECTION 509C – SELECTION OF PROCEDURE
509C.1 General. Except as modified herein, the analysis and design relating to
the structural alteration of existing buildings shall be in accordance with
this code.
509C.2 Selection of Procedure. All buildings shall be analyzed by either the
General Procedure of Section 510C or, when applicable, buildings may be
analyzed by the Special Procedure of Section 511C.
   EXCEPTIONS:
      1.   A building may be strengthened to the Bolts-plus level by complying
only with the requirements for wall anchorage (tension bolts), diaphragm shear
transfer (shear bolts) and out-of-plane wall and parapet and appendage bracing,
provided the entire building complies with all of the following requirements:
         (1)   The building does not have any vertical irregularities of Types

SECTION 512C – ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
512C.1 Analysis of Vertical Elements of the Lateral Force-Resisting System.
General. The following requirements are applicable to both the General
Procedure and Special Procedure.
512C.2 Existing Unreinforced Masonry Walls.
512C.2.1 Flexural rigidity. Flexural components of deflection may be neglected
in determining the rigidity of an unreinforced masonry wall.
512C.2.2 Shear walls with openings. Wall piers shall be analyzed according to
the following procedure which is diagrammed in Figure 5C-2:
512C.2.2.1 For any pier:
   1.   The pier shear capacity shall be calculated as:
      Va = vaAx         (5C-19)
   2.   The pier rocking shear capacity shall be calculated as:
      Vr = 0.5PDD/H      (5C-20)
512C.2.2.2 Pier behavior. The wall piers at any level are acceptable if they
comply with one of the following modes of behavior:
   1.   Rocking controlled mode. When the pier rocking shear capacity is less
than the pier shear capacity, i.e., Vr < Va for each pier in a level, forces in
the wall at that level, Vwx, shall be distributed to each pier in proportion to
PDD/H.
      For the wall at that level:
         Vwx < ΣåVr      (5C-21)
   2.   Shear controlled mode. Where the pier shear capacity is less than the
pier rocking capacity, i.e., Vr<Va in at least one pier in a level, forces in
the wall at the level, Vwx, shall be distributed to each pier in proportion to
D/H.
      For each pier at that level:
         Vp < Va         (5C-22)
      and
         Vp < Vr          (5C-23)
      If Vp<Va for each pier and Vp>Vr for one or more piers, such piers shall
be omitted from the analysis, and the procedure shall be repeated for the
remaining piers, unless the wall is strengthened and reanalyzed.
512C.2.2.3 Masonry pier tension stress. Unreinforced masonry wall piers need
not be analyzed for tension stress.
512C.2.3 Shear walls without openings. Shear walls without openings shall be
analyzed as for walls with openings except that Vr shall be calculated as
follows:
   Vr = (0.50PD+0.25Pw) D/H      (5C-24)
512C.3 Plywood Sheathed Shear Walls. Plywood sheathed shear walls may be used
to resist lateral forces for buildings with wood diaphragms analyzed according
to provisions of Section 510C. Plywood sheathed shear walls may not be used to
share lateral forces with other materials along the same line of resistance.
512C.4 Combinations of Vertical Elements.
512C.4.1 Lateral force distribution. Lateral forces shall be distributed among
the designated vertical resisting elements in a line in proportion to their
relative rigidities except that moment frames shall comply with Section
512C.4.2.
512C.4.2 Moment-resisting frames. A moment frame shall not be used with an
unreinforced masonry wall in a single line of resistance unless the wall has
piers that are capable of sustaining rocking in accordance with Section
512C.2.2 and the frames are designed to carry 100 percent of the lateral
forces, and the story drift ratio shall be limited to 0.0025.
512C.5 Shear Force. The shear force used in the design of any party wall shall
be the sum of the shear forces contributed by each building sharing that wall.

the roof and floor levels as required in Section 510C.2. Ceilings of plaster,
gypsum board or similar heavier materials, when not attached directly to roof
or floor framing, and abutting masonry walls, shall be either anchored to the
walls at a maximum spacing of 6 feet (1.829 m) or removed.
513C.1.2 Anchor requirements. Anchors shall consist of bolts installed through
the wall as specified in Table 5C-E, or by an approved equivalent at a maximum
anchor spacing of 6 feet (1.829 m). All existing wall anchors shall be secured
to the joists to develop the required forces.
513C.1.3 Minimum wall anchorage. Anchorage of masonry walls to each floor or
roof shall resist a minimum force determined in accordance with San Francisco
Building Code
Chapter 16  or 200 pounds per linear foot (298 kg/m), whichever is greater,
acting normal to the wall at the level of the floor or roof. Anchor spacing
shall not exceed 6 feet (1.829 m) on center. Existing through-the-wall anchors,
if used, must meet the requirements of this chapter or must be upgraded.

tension anchors shall be provided within 2 feet (0.609 m) horizontally from the
inside of the corners of the walls.
513C.1.5 Anchors with limited access. When access to the exterior face of the
masonry wall is prevented, wall anchors conforming to Item 4.b. in Table 5C-
E may be used.
513C.1.6 Anchors at interior and party walls. When floor or roof framing aligns
vertically at party and interior masonry walls, continuous anchors shall be
utilized to directly connect the floor or roof framing on either side of the
wall. Where the roof or floor framing is offset more than the least depth of
any adjacent framing, the intervening wall section shall be investigated for
cross wythe shear assuming that the diaphragm to wall tensions on either side
of the wall are acting in opposite directions.
513C.2 Diaphragm Shear Transfer. Bolts transmitting shear forces shall have a
maximum bolt spacing of 6 feet (1.829 m) and shall have nuts installed over

Section 513C.5.2 or by reducing the wall height by bracing per Section
513C.5.3.
513C.5.2 Vertical bracing members. Vertical bracing members shall be attached
to floor and roof construction for their design loads independently of required
wall anchors. Horizontal spacing of vertical bracing members shall not exceed
one-half the unsupported height of the wall nor 10 feet (3.048 m). Deflection
of such bracing members at design loads shall not exceed one-tenth of the wall
thickness.
513C.5.3 Intermediate wall bracing. The wall height may be reduced by bracing
elements connected to the floor or roof. Horizontal spacing of the bracing
elements and wall anchors shall be as required by design but shall not exceed 6
feet (1.829 m) on center. Bracing elements shall be detailed to minimize the
horizontal displacement of the wall by the vertical displacement of the floor
or roof.
513C.6 Parapets. Parapets and appendages not conforming to this chapter shall
be removed, or stabilized or braced to ensure that the parapets and appendages
remain in their original position.
   EXCEPTIONS:
      1.   Parapets, appendages and roof-to wall-tension anchors which have
already been removed, stabilized or braced to comply with Chapter 5D of this
code or previous codes pursuant to an application filed before the effective

      2.   Parapets whose heights do not exceed 3 times their thicknesses need
not be removed, stabilized or braced, provided they are located either
immediately adjacent to a normally inaccessible court or yard or another
building. In the case of an adjoining building, the top of the parapet of the
building under consideration shall not be more than 12 inches (0.305 m) above
the top of the parapet of the adjoining building. In order to qualify for this
exception, the owner must execute an agreement with the Department to
voluntarily abate any hazard that may arise as a result of changed conditions
such as demolition of the adjacent building or development or occupancy of the
adjoining court or yard. The owner must record the agreement with the County
Recorder on a form satisfactory to the Department and supply a copy of the
recorded agreement to the Department.
   Parapets previously exempted that would not be exempted under Exception 2
above shall be removed, or stabilized or braced when the building is
strengthened.
   The maximum height of an unbraced unreinforced masonry parapet above the
lower of either the level of tension anchors or roof sheathing shall not exceed
1½ times the thickness of the parapet wall. If the required parapet height
exceeds this maximum height, a bracing system designed for the forces
determined in accordance with San Francisco Building Code
Chapter 16 shall support the top of the parapet. Parapet corrective work must
be performed in conjunction with the installation of tension roof anchors.
   The minimum height of a parapet above any wall anchor shall be 12 inches
(0.305 m).
   EXCEPTION: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the wall,
the minimum height above the wall anchor may be 6 inches (170.44 mm).

may be acceptable, provided the ties are in good condition and are corrugated
galvanized iron strips not less than 1 inch (25.4 mm) in width, 8 inches (203.2
mm) in length and 1/16 inch (1.59 mm) in thickness or equal.
513C.7.2 Verification. The location and condition of existing veneer anchor
ties shall be verified as follows:
   1.   An approved testing laboratory shall verify the location and spacing of
the ties and shall submit a report to the Building Official for approval as
part of the structural analysis.
   2.   The veneer in a selected area shall be removed to expose a
representative sample of ties (not less than four) for inspection by the
Building Official.
513C.8 Nonstructural Masonry Walls. Unreinforced masonry walls which carry no
design vertical or lateral loads and are not required by the design to be part
of the lateral force resisting system shall be adequately anchored to new or
existing supporting elements. The anchors and elements shall be designed for
the out-of-plane forces specified in San Francisco Building Code
Chapter 16 . The height or length to thickness ratio between such supporting
elements for such walls shall not exceed 13.
513C.9 Truss and Beam Supports. Where trusses and beams, other than rafters or
joists, are supported on masonry, independent secondary columns shall be
installed to support vertical loads of the roof or floor members.

SECTION 514C – IN-PLACE MASONRY SHEAR TESTS
514C.1 Scope. This section applies when this chapter requires in-place testing
of the quality of masonry mortar.
514C.2 Preparation of Sample. The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry
shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the
adjacent bricks in the same wythe. The head joint opposite the loaded end of
the test brick shall be carefully excavated and cleared. The brick adjacent to
the loaded end of the test brick shall be carefully removed by sawing or
drilling and excavating to provide space for a hydraulic ram and steel loading
blocks.
514C.3 Application of Load and Determination of Results. Steel blocks, the size
of the end of the brick, shall be used on each end of the ram to distribute the
load to the brick. The blocks shall not contact the mortar joints. The load
shall be applied horizontally, in the plane of the wythe, until either a crack
can be seen or slip occurs. The strength of the mortar shall be calculated by
dividing the load at the first cracking or movement of the test brick by the
nominal gross area of the sum of the two bed joints.
SECTION 515C – TEST OF ANCHORS IN UNREINFORCED MASONRY WALLS
515C.1 Scope. Shear and tension anchors embedded in existing masonry
construction shall be tested in accordance with this section when and as
required by this chapter.
515C.2 Direct Tension Testing of Existing Anchors and New Bolts. The test
apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall. The distance between the
anchor and the test apparatus support shall not be less than one-half the wall
thickness for existing anchors and 75 percent of the embedment for new embedded
bolts. Existing wall anchors shall be given a preload of 300 pounds (136.4 kg)
prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load
reported shall be recorded at 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) relative movement of the
existing anchor and the adjacent masonry surface. New embedded tension bolts
shall be subject to a direct tension load of not less than 2.5 times the design
load but not less than 1,500 pounds (682 kg) for five minutes (10 percent
deviation).
515C.3 Torque Testing of New Bolts. Bolts which are embedded in unreinforced
masonry walls shall be tested using a torque calibrated wrench to the following
minimum torques:
 
1/2-inch-diameter bolts – 40 foot-pounds.
(12.7 mm) (5.54 M-Kg)
5/8-inch-diameter bolts – 50 foot-pounds.
(16 mm)   (6.93 M-Kg)
3/4-inch-diameter bolts – 60 foot-pounds.
(19 mm)   (8.31 M-Kg)
 
515C.4 Prequalification Test for Bolts and Other Types of Anchors. This section
is applicable when it is desired to use tension or shear values for anchors
greater than those permitted by Table 5C-E. The direct tension test procedure
set forth in Section 515C.2 for existing anchors may be used to determine the
allowable tension values for new embedded or through bolts except that no
preload is required. Bolts shall be installed in the same manner and using the
same materials as will be used in the actual construction. A minimum of 5 tests
for each bolt size and type shall be performed for each class of masonry in
which they are proposed to be used. The allowable tension value for such
anchors shall be 40 percent of the average value of the tests for each size and
type of bolt and class of masonry.
   Shear bolts may be similarly prequalified. The test procedure shall comply
with ASTM E 488-90 or such other procedure as is approved by the Building
Official.
   The allowable values determined in this manner may exceed those set forth in
Table 5C-E.
515C.5 Reports. Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall
include the test results as related to anchor size and type, orientation of
loading, details of the anchor installation and embedment, wall thickness and
joist orientation.
SECTION 516C – POINTING OF UNREINFORCED MASONRY WALLS
516C.1 Scope. Pointing of deteriorated mortar joints when required by this
chapter shall be in accordance with this section.
516C.2 Joint Preparation. The old or deteriorated mortar should be cut out, by
means of a toothing chisel or non-impact power tool, to a uniform depth of ¾
inch (19.1 mm) until sound mortar is reached. Care shall be taken not to damage
the brick edges. After cutting is completed, all loose material shall be
removed with a brush, air or water stream.
516C.3 Mortar Preparation. The mortar mix shall be Type N or S proportions as
required by the construction specifications. The pointing mortar shall be pre-
hydrated by first thoroughly mixing all ingredients dry, and then mixing again,
adding only enough water to produce a damp unworkable mix which will retain its
shape when pressed into a ball. The mortar shall be kept in a damp condition
for 1½ hours; then sufficient water shall be added to bring it to a proper
consistency that is somewhat drier than conventional masonry mortar.
516C.4 Packing. The joint into which the mortar is to be packed shall be damp
but without freestanding water. The mortar shall be tightly packed into the
joint in layers not exceeding ¼ inch (6.35 mm) in depth until it is filled;
then it shall be tooled to a smooth surface to match the original profile.

Section 511C.7 for other restrictions.
2   This value of height-to-thickness ratio may be used only where mortar
shear tests establish a tested mortar shear strength, vt, of not less than 100
psi (689.48 kPa). This value may also be used where the tested mortar strength
is not less than 60 psi (413.69 kPa) and a visual examination of the collar
joint indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage.
3   Where a visual examination of the collar joint indicates not less than 50
percent mortar coverage, and the tested mortar shear strength, vt, is greater
than 30 psi (206.84 kPa) but less than 60 psi (413.69 kPa), the allowable

Add the following Chapter:
Chapter 5E
MANDATORY EARTHQUAKE RETROFIT OF WOOD-FRAME BUILDINGS
SECTION 501E – PURPOSE AND INTENT
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote the health, safety, and welfare of
San Francisco residents as well as the ability of the City and County of San
Francisco to recover from a major earthquake by reducing the possibility of
collapse, major structural damage, or risk of fire caused by an earthquake to
certain wood-frame buildings.
   In furtherance of this purpose, this Chapter establishes seismic retrofit
requirements intended to significantly reduce the collapse risk of residential
buildings with critically vulnerable lower stories and to increase the
likelihood that these buildings will be structurally safe to occupy shortly
after an earthquake. The engineering criteria established by this Chapter
generally limit the structural retrofit work to the ground story or to a
basement or underfloor area that extends above grade where the most critical
vulnerabilities are typically located, thereby improving building performance
while limiting retrofit costs and impacts.
SECTION 502E – SCOPE
   This Chapter shall apply to existing buildings, including mixed-occupancy
buildings, that are Type V (wood-frame) construction of three or more stories
or two stories over a basement or underfloor area that has any portion
extending above grade, and containing five or more dwelling units and for which
a permit for construction of a new building was applied for before January 1,
1978 or which is determined by the Department to have been originally
constructed before January 1, 1978.
   Exceptions:
      1.   A building that has been seismically strengthened to meet or exceed
the standards of Section 304.4 of this Code or its predecessor provisions
within 15 years prior to the operative date of this Chapter is exempt from this
Chapter upon the submittal of documentation showing that such work was properly
permitted, completed, and maintained as required by this Code, and that the
Department has approved such documentation.
      2.   A building that has completed voluntary seismic strengthening under
the provisions of Administrative Bulletin AB-094 is exempt from the
requirements of this Chapter.
SECTION 503E – DEFINITIONS
   In addition to the definitions in San Francisco Building Code
Chapter 2, the following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Chapter:
   DWELLING UNIT. A dwelling unit shall include any individual residential unit
within either an R-1 or an R-2 occupancy building. It shall also include a
guestroom, with or without a kitchen, within either a tourist or residential
hotel or motel but shall not include a “housekeeping room.” A dwelling unit
shall include an area that is occupied as a dwelling unit, whether such is
approved or unapproved for residential use.
   STORY. The first story of any building shall be considered a story, whether
or not previously exempted from story count under an earlier edition of the San
Francisco Building Code.
SECTION 504E – COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
504E.1 General. The owner of each building subject to this Chapter shall comply
with the reporting requirements of this section. If the building is not exempt
and does not meet the minimum criteria specified in this Chapter, the owner
shall cause the building to be retrofitted to conform to such criteria
according to the compliance deadlines set forth in Table 5E-A. Notice of the
compliance requirements shall be given by the Department pursuant to Section
505E.4.
504E.2 Screening Form. The owner of a building who has been notified that their
building is within the scope of this Chapter as well as all other owners of
buildings that may be subject to this Chapter shall engage an architect or
engineer to submit to the Department within the time limits set forth in Table
5E-A a properly completed Screening Form.
   Exception: Buildings exempt based on the exception in Section 502E,
Exception 2 of this Chapter may complete and submit the required Screening Form
without engaging an architect or engineer.
504E.2.1 Required information. The Screening Form to be developed by the
Department shall be used to determine whether a building is or is not subject
to the requirements of this Chapter, and to assign a building to the
appropriate Compliance Tier. The Screening Form shall be completed by an
architect as defined in Section 5500 of the California Business and Professions
Code or by a civil or structural engineer registered pursuant to the provisions
of Section 6700 et seq. of the California Business and Professions Code.
   The submitted Screening Form shall include:
   1.   all information required by the Department to determine compliance
requirements, and
   2.   whether the building is exempt based on Section 502E , Exception 1 of
this Chapter, and
   3.   a Declaration, based on a review of building information, of:
      (a)   whether the building is exempt because it is outside the scope of
this Chapter based on its date of original permit application or construction,
number of dwelling units, or number of stories, or
      (b)   if not exempt, the appropriate Compliance Tier.
504E.2.2 Optional Evaluation Form. The Optional Evaluation Form to be developed
by the Department shall be used to determine if an existing building already
meets the criteria of Section 506E.2 of this Chapter. The Optional Evaluation
Form shall be completed by an architect as defined in Section 5500 of the
California Business and Professions Code or by a civil or structural engineer
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 6700 et seq. of the California
Business and Professions Code. The Optional Evaluation Form shall be
accompanied by a completed Screening Form and shall include:
   1.   dates and scope of any seismic retrofit work, and
   2.   plans and other information as the Department may require that are
sufficient to support the Declaration below, and
   3.   a Declaration of whether the building satisfies the evaluation criteria
given in Section 506E .2 of this Chapter.
504E.3 Compliance Tiers. Each building not exempt from this Chapter shall be
assigned to one of the following Compliance Tiers:
   1.   Tier I: Buildings that contain a Group A, E, R-2.1, R-3.1 or R-
4 occupancy on any story.
   2.   Tier II: Buildings containing 15 or more dwelling units except for
buildings assigned to Tier I or Tier IV.
   3.   Tier III: Buildings not falling within the definition of another tier.
   4.   Tier IV: Buildings that contain a Group B or M occupancy on the first
story or in a basement or under-floor area that has any portion extending above
grade, and buildings that are in mapped liquefaction zones, except for
buildings assigned to Tier I.
504E.4 Application for a building permit. For each non-exempt and non-complying
building, the owner or the owner’s authorized agent shall submit to the
Department an application for a building permit accompanied by the necessary
permit submittal documents indicating the proposed seismic retrofit. A permit
for this seismic retrofit work may include minor ancillary work but shall be
separate from any other permits for building alterations or repairs unless such
work is triggered by or integral to the seismic retrofit work. No work other
than is required under current codes shall be triggered by this seismic
retrofit work.
504E.4.1 Compliance deadlines. Compliance deadlines for the submission of the
Screening Form. Optional Evaluation Form, building permit application and for
completion of seismic retrofit work are given in Table 5E-A. No transfer of
title shall alter the time limits for compliance.

A Compliance Deadlines, if an as-yet unretrofitted building subject to this
Chapter suffers damage from an earthquake or subsequent fire caused by the
earthquake that renders the building uninhabitable, results in structural
damage that triggers retrofit under regulations adopted by the Department of
Building Inspection, or results in “disproportionate damage” as defined in this
Code, such building shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter and
other applicable Sections of this Code within one year of such damage. The
Department may grant an extension of this time period for good cause.
Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter does not supersede the
requirement to comply with Section 504.3 of this Code when otherwise required
by this Code.
504E.5 Historic Preservation. If any portion of the seismic retrofit work will
be visible from the exterior of the subject property and the San Francisco
Planning Department determines that the building is a historic resource, or if
the interior of the building has been given landmark status, the seismic
retrofit work shall be conducted in accordance with guidelines developed by the
San Francisco Planning Department, taking into account provisions of the
California Historical Building Code.
SECTION 505E – PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION; FEE
505E.1 Administrative Bulletin. The Department shall prepare an Administrative

SECTION 506E – ENGINEERING CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND RETROFIT.
506E.1 General. This Chapter requires that evaluation and/or retrofit of
buildings within its scope be undertaken using the engineering criteria
established in this section.
506E.2 Engineering Criteria. A proposed seismic evaluation and/or retrofit plan
shall demonstrate that the building satisfies one of the following:
   1.   FEMA P-807. Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Multi-Unit Wood-Frame
Buildings With Weak First Stories, as detailed in an Administrative Bulletin to
be prepared pursuant to 506E.3 of this ordinance, with the performance
objective of 50 percent maximum probability of exceedance of Onset of Strength
Loss drift limits with a spectral demand equal to 0.50 SMS, or
   2.   ASCE 41-13. Seismic Evaluation and Rehabilitation of Existing
Buildings, with the performance objective of Structural Life Safety in the BSE-
1E earthquake, or
   3.   ASCE 41-06. Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings, with the
performance objective of Structural Life Safety in the BSE-1 earthquake with
earthquake loads multiplied by 75 percent, or
   4.   for evaluation only, ASCE 31-03, Seismic Evaluation of Existing
Buildings. With the performance level of Life Safety, or
   5.   for retrofit only, 2012 International Existing Building Code (IEBC)
Appendix A-4, or
   6.   any other rational design basis deemed acceptable by the Department
that meets or exceeds the intent of this Chapter.
506E.3 Alternative Retrofit Criteria. A proposed seismic retrofit plan which
fails to meet the criteria of 506E.2(1) or 506E.2(5) shall be deemed to comply
with this Chapter if with the approval of the Department, it satisfies the
intent of FEMA P-807, Section 6.4.2 with a maximum acceptable Onset of Strength
Loss drifts limit probability of exceedance of 70 percent.
   Exception: Alternative retrofit criteria shall not apply to buildings in
which the critical stories, basements or underfloor areas contain other than
parking, storage, or utility uses or occupancies.
506E.4 Administrative Bulletin for Technical Requirements. The Department shall
develop and publish one or more Administrative Bulletins that detail the
technical requirements to be used for the evaluation and retrofitting of
buildings required to meet the criteria established in Section 506E.2.
506E.5 Conformance Period. Any building retrofitted in compliance with this
Chapter and properly maintained shall not, within a period of 15 years after
the operative date of this Chapter, be identified as a seismic hazard pursuant
to any local building standards adopted after the date of the building seismic
retrofit unless the building incurred disproportionate damage, or otherwise has
been damaged or altered so that it no longer meets the engineering criteria
under which it was retrofitted.
506E.6 Compliance with this Chapter does not supersede the requirements for
compliance with Section 501E when otherwise under Chapter 5 of this Code. A
permit issued solely for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall
not be considered a “substantial change” or “substantial structural alteration”
as defined in Chapter 5 of this code and compliance with Section 304.4 of this
code will not be requirement by such work.
