SECTION 101A ‚Äì TITLE, SCOPE AND GENERAL
101A.1 Title. These regulations shall be known as the ‚Äú2022 San Francisco
Building Code,‚Äù may be cited as such and will be referred to herein as ‚Äúthis
code.‚Äù The 2022 San Francisco Building Code amends the 2022 California Building
Code and the 2022 California Residential Code which is Part 2 & 2.5
respectively of the 12 parts of the official compilation and publication of the
adoption amendment and repeal of the building regulations to the California
Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building
Standards Code. The California Building Code and California Residential Code
incorporates by adoption the 2021 International Building Code and 2021
International Residential Code respectively of the International Code Council
with necessary California amendments.
101A.2 Purpose. The purpose of this code is to establish the minimum
requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare through
structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability, access to persons
with disabilities, sanitation, adequate lighting and ventilation and energy
conservation, and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards
attributed to the built environment; to regulate and control the demolition of
all buildings and structures, and the quarrying, grading, excavation, and
filling of land; and to provide safety to fire fighters and emergency
responders during emergency operations.
¬†¬†¬†The further purpose of this code is to ensure that barrier-free design is
incorporated in all buildings, facilities, site work and other developments to
which this code applies and to ensure that they are accessible to and usable by
persons with disabilities.
101A.3 Scope. The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures.

modified by local ordinance pursuant to Section 1.1.8, the following standards
in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Parts 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,
9, 10, 11, and 12 shall apply to all occupancies and applications not regulated
by a state agency.
101A.4 Effective Date of this code.
101A.4.1 Only those standards approved by the California Building Standards
Commission and code amendments, additions or deletions adopted by the City and
County of San Francisco that are effective at the time an application for
building permit is deemed acceptable for building plan review by the Department
of Building Inspection shall apply to the plans and specifications for, and to
the construction performed under, that permit. For the effective dates of the
provisions contained in this code, see History Notes page of this code.
101A.4.2 Appendices. Provisions contained in the appendices of this code shall
not apply unless specifically adopted by a state agency or adopted by a local
enforcing agency in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 18901 et
seq. for Building Standards Law, Health and Safety Code Section 17950 for State
Housing Law and Health and Safety Code Section 13869.7 for Fire Protection
Districts.
101A.5 Validity. If any chapter section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase
of this code is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, contrary to
statute, exceeding the authority of the state as stipulated by statutes, or
otherwise inoperative, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portion of this code.
101A.6 Reference Documents. The codes, standards and publications adopted and
set forth in this code, including other codes, standards and publications
referred to therein are, by title and date of publication, hereby adopted as
standard reference documents of this code.
¬†¬†¬†When this code does not specifically cover any subject relating to building
design and construction, recognized architectural or engineering practices
shall be employed. The National Fire Codes and Fire Protection Handbook of the
National Fire Protection Association are permitted to be used as authoritative
guides in determining recognized fire-prevention engineering practices.
¬†¬†¬†In the event of any differences between these building standards and the
standard reference documents, the text of these building standards shall
govern.
101A.7 Order of Precedence.
101A.7.1 Specific provisions. Where a specific provision varies from a general
provision, the specific provision shall apply.
101A.7.2 Conflicts. When the requirements of this code conflict with the
requirements of any other part of the California Building Standards Code, Title

any regulation or requirement adopted by the Public Utilities Commission or
other City agency under its Charter authority, the most restrictive requirement
shall prevail.

requirements of the state fire marshal.
Sections 101A.8 ‚Äì 101A.19 are reserved.

Bureau and the concerned departments and bureaus, shall analyze the cost to the
City and County of San Francisco of regulation and inspection required by each

ordinance, which shall not be less than the cost to the City and County of San
Francisco of such regulation and inspection.

to be used to indicate the condition of a building or structure after a natural
or human-created disaster. A description of the placards to be used is set

affixed to each placard. In addition, each placard shall include the following
language or its equivalent as determined by the Building Official: Any
unauthorized removal, alteration, or covering of this placard shall be
considered a violation of the San Francisco Building Code and the responsible
person(s) shall be subject to applicable penalties set forth in the code. A

structure.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†RESTRICTED USE. This placard is to be posted on each building or
structure that is damaged to such an extent that restrictions on continued
occupancy are required. The person or persons authorized to post this placard

considered to be a demolition order. The person or persons authorized to post
this placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered.
101A.21.3 Removal or alteration prohibited. Once it has been attached to a
building or structure, a placard is not to be removed, altered, or covered

or by reason of occupancy or use in violation of law or ordinance, or were
erected, moved, altered, constructed or maintained in violation of law or
ordinance are, for the purpose of this chapter, unsafe.
¬†¬†¬†Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that property or
properties either improved or unimproved are unstable because of landslide,
subsidence or inundation or that such occurrences are deemed imminent as
described above, the Building Official shall give written notice to the owner
or owners that said property or properties are unsafe. The notice shall specify
the conditions creating the unsafe classification.
¬†¬†¬†All such unsafe buildings, structures, property, or portions thereof, are
hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be vacated, repaired, altered

when requested to do so by the enforcing agency.
¬†¬†¬†Note: ‚ÄúFire hazard‚Äù as used in these regulations means any condition,
arrangement or act which will increase, or may cause an increase of, the hazard
or menace of fire to a greater degree than customarily recognized as normal by

delay or hindrance to the prevention, suppression or extinguishment of fire.

of any building, structure or property for the purpose of determining whether
it is unsafe whenever:

such inspection is necessary or desirable; or,
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†Any person or any agency or department of the City submits to the
Building Official a complaint which, in the Building Official‚Äôs opinion,
establishes reasonable cause to believe that the building, structure or
property or any portion thereof is unsafe.
102A.3.1 Dwelling Units constructed or installed without required permit(s). In
the case of an unauthorized Dwelling Unit constructed or installed in an
existing building without the required permit or permits, in addition to the
above requirements the written notice of violation shall order the property

determined that a serious and imminent hazard exists on the property. If
approval of either legalization or removal of the unauthorized Dwelling Unit
occurs within one year of issuance of the notice of violation, the notice of
violation and any liens recorded against the property with respect to the
violation will be rescinded. The Building Official may extend this time if a
delay in obtaining approval is not the fault of the property owner.

health or safety of the occupants or other persons, or to such building,
structure, or property requiring prompt action to correct said condition, the
Building Official shall have the power to issue an order in writing detailing
the serious and imminent hazard conditions and requiring:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†That the building, structure, property, or portion thereof, be vacated
and thereafter be kept vacant until the Building Official gives written
permission that the same may be reoccupied, without giving the notice and
holding the hearing prescribed in Sections
102A.4 through
102A.6, whenever, by reason of serious and imminent danger, prompt vacating of
the premises, building, structure or property, or a portion thereof, appears
necessary in the judgment of the Building Official;
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†That the building, structure, property, or a portion thereof, be

means as the Building Official may deem advisable if the owner and all other
persons having an interest in the building, structure, or property have failed,
for a period of not more than 48 hours after the posting and service of the
order, to comply with the order.
¬†¬†¬†Whenever the Building Official orders that repairs or alterations be made

102A.16.1 Continuing or Recurring Conditions Creating a Fire Hazard in a
Residential Building of Three or More Dwelling Units; Authority of the Building
Official. In addition to any other power or remedy available under this Code or
other applicable laws, the Building Official may issue a Fire Life Safety
Notice and Order pursuant to the provisions of this Section
102A.16.1 and Sections
102A.16.1.1 and
102A.16.1.2 that requires the owner of a residential building with three or
more dwelling units to install, improve, or upgrade the building‚Äôs fire safety
systems.
102A.16.1.1 Fire Life Safety Notice and Order. The Building Official may issue
a Fire Life Safety Notice and Order in cases where the Building Official has
determined that:
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†notwithstanding the Department‚Äôs issuance of two or more NOVs and
Administrative Orders under Sections
102A.4 and
102A.7 of this Code for violation of the fire safety requirements enforced by
the Department of Building Inspection, a fire hazard (as defined in Section
102A.1) continues to exist or recurs after abatement in a residential building
with three or more dwelling units; and
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†while the cited code violations have not risen to the level of an
imminent hazard that requires issuance of an emergency order under Section
102A.16, the violations are so extensive and of such a nature (including but
not limited to conditions such as a nonworking fire alarm or sprinkler system,
a nonworking or chronically blocked fire escape, or locked or chronically
blocked exits or egress system) that the health and safety of the residents
and/or the general public is substantially endangered; and
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†the property owner either has failed to abate or mitigate the
violations in a timely way in accordance with an Administrative Order issued
pursuant to Section
102A.7 of this Code, or the violations recur after abatement.
102A.16.1.1.1 Legal Status of Previously Issued NOVs. A Fire Life Safety Notice
and Order issued pursuant to Section
102A.16.1.1 is in lieu of a Notice of Municipal Code Violation (‚ÄúNOV‚Äù) and an
Administrative Order issued pursuant to Sections
102A.4 and
102A.7 of this Code. However, such an Order does not replace any NOVs that have
previously been issued and remain unabated. Any previously-issued NOVs shall
require abatement pursuant to their terms.
102A.16.1.1.2 Required Provisions of a Fire Life Safety Notice and Order. The
Fire Life Safety Notice and Order issued pursuant to Section

code requirements;
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†install a new fire alarm and/or detection system;
¬†¬†¬†(d)¬†¬†¬†improve an existing fire alarm and/or detection system or upgrade it
to current code requirements.
¬†¬†¬†Prior to ordering any such installation, improvement, or upgrade, the
Building Official shall provide the notice required by Section
102A.16.1.1.3 below and consult with the local fire code official. The local
fire official shall approve any installation, improvement, or upgrade ordered
by the Building Official.
102A.16.1.1.3 Warning Statements and Letter Prior to Issuance of Fire Life
Safety Notice and Order. Each NOV or Administrative Order issued pursuant to
Sections
102A.4 and
102A.7 of this Code that includes a fire safety violation shall provide
information about Section
102A.16.1 et seq. and the consequences for not abating fire safety violations
within the specified compliance period. In addition, prior to issuance of a
Fire Life Safety Notice and Order, the Building Official shall send a letter by
regular and certified mail to the building owner at the address listed with the
Assessor-Recorder‚Äôs Office and to the persons or entities listed in Section
102A.16.1.2(b) below informing them that because the building has been cited
with two or more fire-safety related NOVs and Administrative Orders under
Sections
102A.4 and
102A.7 of this Code, the owner is a potential recipient of a Fire Life Safety
Notice and Order.
102A.16.1.2 Notice and Hearing Procedures. All the notice and hearing
procedures set forth in Sections
102A.4 through
102A.7 shall apply to a Fire Life Safety Notice and Order, except as that

premises involved;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(2)¬†¬†¬†the holder of any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or encumbrance of
record; and

¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†if the Abatement Appeals Board had heard an appeal of any previously-
issued Order of Abatement pursuant to Section
102A for substantially the same code violations as are cited in the Fire Life
Safety Notice and Order, and the Abatement Appeals Board had upheld the Order
of Abatement in whole or substantial part, the decision of the Abatement
Appeals Board shall be effective immediately upon issuance of the Board‚Äôs
findings and decision with no right to request rehearing.
102A.16.1.4 Recording of final Notice and Order; referral to City Attorney.

Table 1A-K ‚Äì Penalties, Hearings, Code Enforcement Assessments ‚Äì for applicable
rates.
102A.18 Report of Costs, Notice of Hearing on Confirmation.
102A.18.1 Preparation of delinquency report. If any penalty or assessment
imposed pursuant to Section
102A is not received within the required time period, the Building Official
shall initiate proceedings to make the penalty or assessment, plus accrued
interest, a special assessment lien against the real property which is the
subject of the penalty or assessment. The Building Official shall prepare a
delinquency report for the Board of Supervisors. For each delinquent account,
the report shall contain the owner‚Äôs name, the amount due, including interest,
and a description of the real property. The report shall also indicate which of
the delinquent accounts should be exempted from the lien procedure because of
the small amounts involved, or because another debt collection procedure is
more appropriate. The descriptions of the parcels shall be those used for the
same parcels on the Recorder/Assessor‚Äôs Office records for the current year.
102A.18.2 Notice. Five days prior to forwarding the delinquency report to the
Board of Supervisors, the Building Official shall serve copies of the report in
the manner prescribed in Section
102A.4 and shall post the report at the subject properties. Upon receipt of the
report, the Board of Supervisors shall fix a time, date and place for hearing
the report and any protests or objections thereto, and shall mail notice of the

hearing on the report along with protests or objections by the representatives
of the real property liable to be assessed for such delinquent accounts. The
Board of Supervisors may make such revisions, corrections, or modifications of
the report as it may deem just, after which, by motion or resolution, the
report shall be confirmed. The Board of Supervisor‚Äôs decision on the report and
on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive and shall
constitute confirmation of the report; provided, however, that any delinquent
account may be removed from the report by payment in full at any time prior to
confirmation of the report. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall cause
the confirmed report to be verified in form sufficient to meet recording
requirements.
102A.19.2 Collection of assessment. Upon confirmation of the report by the
Board of Supervisors, the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute
a special assessment against the property identified in the report. Each such
assessment shall be subordinate to all existing special liens previously
imposed upon such property and shall be paramount to all other liens except
those for State, County and municipal taxes with which it shall be in parity.
The lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest due and payable
thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement
of municipal taxes shall be applicable to said special assessment.
102A.19.3 Recordation charges. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall
cause the confirmed and verified report to be recorded in the Assessor-
Recorder‚Äôs Office within 10 days of its confirmation. The special assessment
lien on each parcel or property described in said report shall include
additional charges for administrative expenses. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-K ‚Äì Penalties, Hearings, Code Enforcement Assessments ‚Äì for Lien
Recordation charges.
102A.19.4 Filing with Controller and Tax Collector; distribution of proceeds.
After the report is recorded, the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall file
a certified copy with the Controller and Tax Collector, whereupon it shall be
the duty of said officers to add the amount of said special assessment to the
next regular bill for taxes levied against said parcel or parcels, and
thereafter said amount shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary taxes are collected for the City and County of San
Francisco, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedures
for foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as is provided for property
taxes.
102A.19.5 Release of lien, recording fee. Upon payment to the Tax Collector of
the special assessment, the Tax Collector shall cause a release lien to be
recorded with the Assessor-Recorder‚Äôs Office, and from the sum collected
pursuant to Section
102A.19.3 above, shall pay to the Assessor-Recorder‚Äôs Office the required
recording fee.
102A.20 Continuance of Gas and Electricity. In the event that electricity or
gas service to a building, structure, property, or portion thereof is about to
be discontinued by the utility company for nonpayment of bills, the Building
Official, through the issuance of an Emergency Order, may order that the
utility company continue said service to protect the life, health and safety of
the occupants. Said order shall be issued pursuant to the provisions of Section
102A.16 of this code and shall remain in force for six months, unless otherwise
specified by the Building Official.
¬†¬†¬†The funds for the continuance of said services shall be provided from the
Repair and Demolition Fund. Said costs and administrative costs incurred by the

rate.
¬†¬†¬†If payment is not received from the property owner within the required time
period, a Report of Costs pursuant to Section
102A.18 shall be prepared for all such costs. Submittal, confirmation,
recordation and collection of the special assessment shall follow the
procedures provided in Section
102A.19.
¬†¬†¬†The provisions of Section
102A.20 shall only apply to buildings, structures, property, or portions
thereof for which the owner, and not the tenant, is responsible for payment of
said utility bills.

103A.6 Expanded Compliance Control and permit review.
103A.6.1 Significant violation tracking reports. When a building inspector
issues a Notice of Violation in which there is an instance of:
¬†¬†¬†(1)¬†¬†¬†Misrepresentation of existing conditions or project scope that results
in circumvention of notification or review requirements;
¬†¬†¬†(2)¬†¬†¬†Structural work or demolition of structural features without or beyond
the scope of a building permit;
¬†¬†¬†(3)¬†¬†¬†Work under permit performed by a party without required license; or
¬†¬†¬†(4)¬†¬†¬†Other substantial non-compliance;
Inspection Services Division shall log the violation and identify all
individuals, agents, and other entities associated with the permit and/or
project in the Permit Tracking System or known to be associated with the permit
and/or project at the time the Notice of Violation is issued in the Compliance
Control Tracking File maintained by the Inspection Services Division. The
Compliance Control Tracking File is for internal purposes only; an individual,
agent, or entity‚Äôs presence in the file does not indicate responsibility for
any violation or misconduct.
103A.6.2 Candidates for Expanded Compliance Control.
¬†¬†¬†(1)¬†¬†¬†The Inspection Services Division shall review the Compliance Control
Tracking File on a monthly basis to determine if any project, individual,
agent, or entity has been associated with three or more reported violations
described in
103A.6.1 within the last 18 months. Any such project, individual, agent, or
entity shall be a candidate for Expanded Compliance Control.
¬†¬†¬†(2)¬†¬†¬†Even if the three-or-more-violations standard is not met during the
18-month period, the Department, in consultation with the City Attorney, may
designate a project, individual, agent, or entity as a candidate for Expanded
Compliance Control for any violation or violations that the Department
determines, individually or together, to be egregious and create significant
risk to health, safety, or property.
103A.6.3 Expanded Compliance Control List.
103A.6.3.1 Factors. In determining whether to include any candidate on the
Expanded Compliance Control List, the following factors shall be considered:
the candidate‚Äôs role and conduct that contributed to the violations; any
impacts on individual or public health, and safety; whether the
misrepresentation of existing conditions or the misrepresentation of project
scope was reckless or intentional to avoid permit review or notification
requirements; the extent of the demolition or work that occurred without or
beyond the scope of a building permit or without the necessary license or
certification; any impacts on historically significant structures; prospective
undervaluation of the construction cost that resulted in lower permit fees from
the violations; and the number, frequency, and severity of violations.
103A.6.3.2 Process. For each project, individual, agent, or entity designated
as a candidate for Expanded Compliance Control, the following actions shall be
taken:
¬†¬†¬†(1)¬†¬†¬†Inspection Services staff, designated by the Director of the
Department of Building Inspection, shall notify the candidate and request any
exculpatory information as to why Expanded Compliance Control is not warranted
and shall draft a summary report detailing the violation(s) and exculpatory
evidence or arguments, if any, relevant to whether the candidate warrants
Expanded Compliance Control.
¬†¬†¬†(2)¬†¬†¬†The summary report shall conclude with a determination:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†that the candidate should be placed on the Expanded Compliance
Control List, and provide written findings, including but not limited to
findings in response to the factors described in
103A.6.3.1, supporting that determination; or
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†that the candidate should not be placed on the Expanded Compliance
Control List, and provide written findings, including but not limited to
findings in response to the factors described in
103A.6.3.1, for why the candidate does not warrant Expanded Compliance Control.
¬†¬†¬†(3)¬†¬†¬†The Director of the Department of Building Inspection shall review all
Expanded Compliance Control determinations made by designated staff and shall
make a final determination either affirming or overruling the determination.
The Director shall either adopt the staff findings or issue the Director‚Äôs own
written findings detailing the basis for the final determination. The
Department shall notify the candidate in writing of the Director‚Äôs final
determination and shall post the final determination on the Department‚Äôs
website in a manner that complies with section
104A.6.
¬†¬†¬†(4)¬†¬†¬†Any person may appeal the Director‚Äôs final determination to the
Building Inspection Commission pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 77 of the
Administrative Code.
¬†¬†¬†(5)¬†¬†¬†The Director shall maintain the Expanded Compliance Control List on
the Department‚Äôs website and shall provide the list to the Building Inspection
Commission on a quarterly basis commencing when the first project, individual,
agent, or entity is placed on the list.

103A.6.1, by a listee shall extend the period of Expanded Compliance Control
for that listee by five years from the date of the subsequent violation(s).

applicable); and notify all parties listed on the applications or addenda for
these permits of the Expanded Compliance Control requirement;
¬†¬†¬†(3)¬†¬†¬†Require site inspections by the Department of Building Inspection and
Planning Department prior to issuing any permit submitted by or containing
reference to the listee;
¬†¬†¬†(4)¬†¬†¬†Require that a licensed contractor be named on the permit prior to
issuance, unless the applicant is filing for the permit as an Owner-Builder, in
conformance with California Health and Safety Code Section 19825;
¬†¬†¬†(5)¬†¬†¬†Dedicate a Senior Inspector to perform inspections and respond to any
complaints or requests regarding the listee; and

plan review staff on how to recognize and flag permits that signal potential
abuse. All guidance and training materials and procedures shall be prepared
with a goal of being sensitive to the cultural differences of individuals,
agents, and other entities associated with permits and/or projects as well as
current and future building occupants, workers, or adjacent neighbors. Further,
the Department shall create and implement guidelines for staff to escalate any
permits that indicate potential abuse to senior review staff for their review
and refer such permits to the Planning Department to ensure they are consistent
with preceding Planning Department approvals.
SECTION 104A ‚Äì ORGANIZATION AND ENFORCEMENT
104A.1 Enforcement agency. The Department of Building Inspection shall be the
administering and enforcing agency under this code.
104A.2 Powers and duties of Building Official.
104A.2.1 General. The Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to
enforce all the provisions of this code. For such purposes, the Building
Official shall have the powers of a law enforcement officer.
¬†¬†¬†Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 13108, upon the written request
of the chief fire official of any city, county or fire-protection district, the
State Fire Marshal may authorize such chief fire official and his or her
authorized representatives, in their geographical area of responsibility, to
make fire-prevention inspections of state-owned or state-occupied buildings,
other than state institutions, for the purpose of enforcing the regulations
relating to fire and panic safety adopted by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to
this section and building standards relating to fire and panic safety published
in the California Building Standards Code. Authorization from the State Fire
Marshal shall be limited to those fire departments or fire districts which
maintain a fire-prevention bureau staffed by paid personnel.
¬†¬†¬†Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 13108, any requirement or order
made by any chief fire official who is authorized by the State Fire Marshal to
make fire-prevention inspections of state-owned or state occupied buildings,
other than state institutions, may be appealed to the State Fire Marshal. The
State Fire Marshal shall, upon receiving an appeal and subject to the
provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 18945) of Part 2, 5 of
Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, determine if the requirement or
order made is reasonably consistent with the fire and panic safety regulations
adopted by the Office of the State Fire Marshal and building standards relating
to fire and panic safety published in the California Building Code.
¬†¬†¬†The Building Official shall have the power to render interpretations of this
code and to adopt and enforce rules and supplemental regulations to clarify the
application of its provisions. Such interpretations, rules and regulations
shall be in conformance with the intent and purpose of this code. Such rules
and regulations, commonly referred to as Code Rulings and Administrative
Bulletins supplemental to this code shall not take effect until approved by the
Building Inspection Commission and signed by the Building Official except in
unusual circumstances where the Building Official has determined that there is
an immediate need to protect the public health and safety. When the Building
Official finds that such circumstances exist, the Building Official may order
immediate enforcement of a particular rule or regulation. The Building Official
shall arrange for a subscription service to such rules and regulations, the
entire cost of which is to be borne by the subscribers.
¬†¬†¬†NOTE: ‚ÄúCode Rulings‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdministrative Bulletins‚Äù may be found in the
Department‚Äôs Rules and Regulations printed at the back of this code.
104A.2.2 Deputies. In accordance with prescribed procedures and with the
approval of the appointing authority, the building official may appoint such
number of technical officers and inspectors and other employees as shall be
authorized from time to time. The building official may deputize such
inspectors or employees as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the
code enforcement agency.
104A.2.3 Right of entry. When it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce
the provisions of this code or other codes or ordinances, or when the Building
Official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a building or
upon a premises a condition that is contrary to or in violation of this code or
other codes or ordinances that makes the building or premises unsafe, dangerous
or hazardous, the Building Official may enter the building or premises at
reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this code or
other codes or ordinances, provided that if such building or premises be
occupied that credentials be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If
such building or premises be unoccupied, the Building Official shall first make
a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or
control of the building or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the
Building Official shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure
entry.
104A.2.4 Stop orders.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†Whenever any work is being done contrary to the provisions of this
code, or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement
of this code, the building official may order the work stopped by notice in
writing served on any persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to be
done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by
the building official to proceed with the work.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†If the building official determines that a project has a history of
repeated violations of this code or other pertinent laws or ordinances
implemented through the enforcement of this code, the building official may
stop all work on the project until all the code violations have been fully
investigated and resolved. The director of any department with permitting
authority for the project, including but not limited to the Director of Public
Works and the Director of Planning, may request the building official to stop
all work on the project pending an investigation and resolution of the code
violations at issue.
104A.2.5 Occupancy violations. Whenever any building, structure, property or
portion thereof regulated by this code is being used contrary to the provisions
of this code or the code in effect at the time the use was commenced, the
Building Official may order such use discontinued and the building, structure,
property or portion thereof, vacated by notice served on any person involved in
said use or causing such use to be continued. Such person shall discontinue the
use within the time prescribed by the Building Official after receipt of such
notice to make the building, structure, property or portion thereof, comply
with the requirements of this code; provided, however, that in the event of an
unsafe building, structure or property the provisions of Section
102A shall apply.
104A.2.6 Liability. The Building Official charged with the enforcement of this
code, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties
required by this code or other pertinent law or ordinance shall not thereby be
rendered personally liable for damages that may accrue to persons or property
as a result of an act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of
such duties. A suit brought against the building official or employee because
of such act or omission performed by the building official or employee in the
enforcement of any provision of such codes or other pertinent laws or
ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or enforced by the
code enforcement agency shall be defended by this jurisdiction until final
termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom shall be
assumed by this jurisdiction.
¬†¬†¬†This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or
structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall
the code enforcement agency or its parent jurisdiction be held as assuming any
such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this code or any
permits or certificates issued under this code.
104A.2.7 Modifications. When there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of this code, the building official may grant
modifications for individual cases. The building official shall first find that
a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this code impractical
and that the modifications are in conformance with the intent and purpose of
this code and that such modifications does not lessen any fire-protection
requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The details of any action
granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the code
enforcement agency.
104A.2.7.1 Local equivalencies. Due to unique topographical conditions in the
City and County of San Francisco, including but not limited to the City‚Äôs built
environment and historic pattern of development, equivalencies to certain code
requirements have been developed by the Department and are approved on an
individual basis if specific conditions are met. Wherever in this code a
reference to Local Equivalency is made, details of the equivalency to the
specific code requirement may be found in the Department‚Äôs Rules and
Regulations printed at the back of this code.
104A.2.8 Alternate materials, design, and methods of construction. The
provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the use of any material,
alternate design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this
code, provided any alternate has been approved and its use authorized by the
building official.
¬†¬†¬†The building official may approve any such alternate, provided the building
official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the
provisions of this code and that the material, method or work offered is, for
the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code
in suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety
and sanitation.
¬†¬†¬†The building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be
submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding its use. The

order to legalize one existing unauthorized dwelling unit on the property. The
application(s) shall refer explicitly to this Section
106A .3.1.3 and Section 207.3 of the Planning Code. If there is more than one
existing unauthorized unit on the site, the owner or agent shall designate the
unauthorized unit for which legalization is sought. The approval, issuance,

¬†¬†¬†WARNING
¬†¬†¬†Under San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.3.2.4.2, certain building permits may be issued only after the permittee
analyzes the soil and/or groundwater for the presence of hazardous substances
and, where applicable, the Department of Public Health has approved the
permittee‚Äôs site mitigation plan. In issuing this permit, neither the City nor
any of its officers or employees make any representation that the soil and/or
groundwater on or about the site is free from the presence of hazardous
substances. Nor does the City‚Äôs implementation of this process relieve any
person from their duties and responsibilities relating to hazardous substance
contamination under state and federal law. Neither subsurface soil analysis
under Building Code Section
106A.3.2.4.2 nor the issuance of this permit is intended to alter, extinguish,
or transfer these responsibilities.

requirements of this section shall be deemed to be complete until the
Department receives written notification from the Director of Public Health
that the applicant has complied with all applicable provisions of Article 31 of
the Health Code. Approvals or conditions imposed in writing by the Department
of Public Health shall become conditions of the permit issued by the
Department, and violation of such approvals or conditions shall be deemed a
violation of the permit.

either
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†written notification from the Director of Public Health that the
applicant either has a site-specific dust control plan for the project approved
by the Director of Public Health or the Director of Public Health has waived
the requirement or
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†the applicant qualifies as an interior only tenant improvement project
that will not produce exterior visible dust and therefore is exempt from
complying with Article 22B of the San Francisco Health Code.
¬†¬†¬†EXCEPTION: The Director may issue a site permit pursuant to Section
106A.3.4.2 prior to the time an applicant complies with this section.
106A.3.2.6.3 General dust control requirements.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†All site preparation work, demolition or construction activities
within the City and County of San Francisco that have the potential to create
dust or will expose or disturb more than 10 cubic yards or 500 square feet of
soil shall comply with the requirements of this Section whether or not the
activity requires a permit from the Department of Building Inspection.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†For projects over one half acre in size, the project sponsor shall
designate a person or persons who will be responsible for monitoring compliance
with dust control requirements. The designated person or persons shall be on
the site or available by telephone or other means during all times that site
preparation, demolition or construction activities may be in progress,
including holidays and weekends. The name and telephone number where such
person or persons may be reached at all times shall be provided to the Director
and to the Director of Public Health prior to commencement of work on the
project.
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†The project sponsor and the contractor responsible for construction
activities at the project site shall use the following practices to control
construction dust on the site or other practices that result in equivalent dust
control that are acceptable to the Director.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(1)¬†¬†¬†Water all active construction areas sufficiently to prevent dust
from becoming airborne. Increased watering frequency may be necessary whenever
wind speeds exceed 15 miles per hour. Reclaimed water must be used if required
by Article 21, Section 1100¬†et seq. of the San Francisco Public Works Code. If
not required, reclaimed water should be used whenever possible.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(2)¬†¬†¬†Provide as much water as necessary to control dust (without
creating run-off) in any area of land clearing, earth movement, excavation,
drillings, and other dust-generating activity.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(3)¬†¬†¬†During excavation and dirt-moving activities, wet sweep or vacuum
the streets, sidewalks, paths, and intersections where work is in progress at
the end of the workday.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(4)¬†¬†¬†Cover any inactive (no disturbance for more than seven days)
stockpiles greater than ten cubic yards or 500 square feet of excavated
materials, backfill material, import material, gravel, sand, road base, and
soil with a 10 mil (0.01 inch) polyethylene plastic or equivalent tarp and
brace it down or use other equivalent soil stabilization techniques.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(5)¬†¬†¬†Use dust enclosures, curtains, and dust collectors as necessary to
control dust in the excavation area.
106A.3.2.6.4 Large projects. If the project is over one half acre in size and
the project does not qualify for an interior only tenant improvement project
exemption or the Department of Public Health has not issued a waiver for a
site-specific dust control plan for the project; construction, demolition,
excavation, grading, foundation work, or other permitted activities may not
commence until the owner or the owner‚Äôs agent has submitted to the Department a
copy of the Director of Public Health‚Äôs written approval of the dust control
plan. All site preparation and construction activities on the job site shall
comply with the general requirements for dust control and the site-specific
dust control plan approved by the Director of Public Health. The failure to
comply with all provisions of the approved site-specific dust control plan
shall be considered a violation of this Code.
106A.3.2.6.5 Waiver of requirements for compliance for small sites; rescission
of waiver. For sites less than a half acre in size:
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†The Director may waive these requirements if the applicant
demonstrates to the Director‚Äôs satisfaction that the proposed site preparation,
demolition or construction activities are unlikely to result in any visible
windblown dust.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†If at any time, contrary to the applicant‚Äôs assertions, the
construction activities produce visible windblown dust, the Director may issue
a written order rescinding the waiver. A copy of the rescission order shall be
personally served on the owner of the property at the address on file with the
Department of Building Inspection and posted on the job site.
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†If the Director orders rescission of the waiver, the owner of the
property and the contractor or other persons responsible for construction
activities at the site shall comply immediately with the above dust control
requirements.
106A.3.2.6.6 Permit notification. All building, demolition, excavation,
grading, foundation, or other permit subject to this section issued by the
Department of Building Inspection shall bear notice of the above requirements
and of the owner‚Äôs responsibility to control construction dust on the site.
106A.3.2.6.7 Violations. Upon receipt of complaints, the Director is authorized
to administer and enforce all provisions of this Section and may enforce the
provisions of this Section by any lawful means available for such purpose,
including taking actions authorized pursuant to Section
103A of this Code.
106A.3.2.6.8 Fees. The Department shall determine and recommend to the Board of
Supervisors the amount of fee that is required to compensate the Department for
the costs of enforcing these dust control requirements.

the site permit such that all interdepartmental review of electronically
submitted applications is conducted simultaneously.
¬†¬†¬†The scope of review of the site permit is limited. The Building Official
reviews the site permit to assure that there are no major issues with the
proposed construction that need resolution before proceeding to detailed design
of a code-complying structure. There is no detailed plan review required at the
time of site permit review, nor shall a site permit be withheld in order to
conduct detailed plan review. Detailed review of plans, along with any
associated revisions, modifications, or comments, will be conducted during
addendum review after the site permit is issued.

as provided in this section, shall be made in this area.
106A.4.1.3.2 Purpose. Because landslides, earth movement, ground shaking and
subsidence are likely to occur on or near the Northwest Mt. Sutro Slope
Protection Area, causing severe damage and destruction to public and private
improvements, the Board of Supervisors finds that the public health, safety and
welfare is best protected if the Building Official of Building Inspection
causes permit applications within the Northwest Mt. Sutro Slope Protection Area
for either (1) construction of new buildings or structures or (2) alterations
that involve a substantial increase in the envelope of an existing building or
structure, to be peer reviewed for structural integrity and effect on hillside
stability. The requirements herein for projects in the Northwest Mt. Sutro
Slope Protection Area are in addition to all other applicable laws and
regulations, including any and all requirements for environmental review under
the California Environmental Quality Act; compliance with the requirements
contained herein does not excuse a project sponsor from compliance with any
other applicable laws and regulations.
106A.4.1.3.3 Mandatory review by Structural Advisory Committee and other city
officials. All permit applications submitted to the Central Permit Bureau for
construction of new buildings or structures or alterations that involve a
substantial increase in the envelope of an existing building or structure (as
determined by the Building Official) within the Northwest Mt. Sutro Slope
Protection Area shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Structural Advisory
Committee, as defined by Building Code Section
105A.6. No permits for such properties located within the Northwest Mt. Sutro
Slope Protection Area shall be issued unless and until the Building Official
has consulted with and received a written communication from representatives of
the Department of Planning, Department of Public Works and Fire Department,
each of whom has made a visit to the site for which the project is proposed,

shall consider the effect that construction activity related to the proposed
project will have on the safety and stability of the Northwest Mt. Sutro Slope
Protection Area.
106A.4.1.3.4 Mandatory denial by Building Official. In the event that the
Structural Advisory Committee determines that there is a reasonable likelihood
that the proposed design and construction would result in unsafe conditions or
would increase the likelihood of hillside instability, and such unsafe
conditions or instability cannot be mitigated to the satisfaction of the
Structural Advisory Committee, the Building Official shall deny the permit. The
Building Official‚Äôs decision to deny the permit is appealable only to the Board
of Appeals.
106A.4.1.4 The Slope and Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act. This Section of
the San Francisco Building Code shall be known as the Slope and Seismic Hazard
Zone Protection Act.
106A.4.1.4.1 Creation. The Slope and Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act shall
apply to all property within San Francisco that exceeds an average slope of 4
horizontal to 1 vertical grade or falls within certain mapped areas of the
City, except those properties already subject to the Edgehill Mountain Slope
Protection Area or the Northwest Mt. Sutro Slope Protection Area. For purposes
of this Section ‚Äúproperty‚Äù shall mean a legal lot of record. Heightened review
of certain permit applications, as provided in this section, shall be given to
all property subject to this Act.
106A.4.1.4.2 Purpose. Because landslides, earth movement, ground shaking,
drainage issues, and subsidence are likely to occur on or near steeply sloped
properties and within other defined areas causing severe damage and destruction
to public and private improvements, the Board of Supervisors finds that the
public health, safety, and welfare is best protected if the Building Official
causes permit applications for the construction of new buildings or structures
and certain other construction work on property subject to the Slope and
Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act to undergo additional review for structural
integrity and effect on hillside or slope stability. The requirements for
projects subject to the Slope and Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act are in
addition to all other applicable laws and regulations, including any and all
requirements for environmental review under the California Environmental
Quality Act; compliance with the requirements contained herein does not excuse
a project sponsor from compliance with any other applicable laws and
regulations.
106A.4.1.4.3 Scope.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†Properties are subject to these requirements where: (1) any portion of
the property lies within the areas of ‚ÄúEarthquake-Induced Landslide‚Äù in the
Seismic Hazard Zone Map, released by the California Department of Conservation,
Division of Mines and Geology, dated November 17, 2000, or amendments thereto
or (2) the property exceeds an average slope of 4 horizontal to 1 vertical
slope.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†Proposed construction work that is subject to these requirements
includes the construction of new buildings or structures having over 1,000
square feet of new projected roof area and horizontal or vertical additions
having over 500 square feet of new projected roof area. In addition, these
requirements shall apply to the following activity or activities: shoring,
underpinning, excavation, or retaining wall work; grading, including excavation
or fill, of over 50 cubic yards of earth materials; or any other construction
activity that, in the opinion of the Building Official, may have a substantial
impact on the slope stability of any property.
106A.4.1.4.4 Mandatory submittal and review of reports.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†All permit applications submitted to the Central Permit Bureau for
construction work on properties subject to the Slope and Seismic Hazard Zone
Protection Act shall include report(s) prepared and signed by both a licensed
geologist and a licensed geotechnical engineer identifying areas of potential
slope instability, defining potential risks of development due to geological
and geotechnical factors, including information required by this section
106A.4.1.4.4 and Departmental guidelines and regulations, and making
recommendations regarding the proposed development. These reports shall undergo
review as deemed appropriate by the Building Official or by their designated
staff. Such review shall involve an internal review by Departmental staff. The
Building Official, in their discretion, may require third party peer review
from a licensed geotechnical engineer. After third party peer review, the
Building Official, in their discretion, may establish a Structural Advisory
Committee, as defined by Building Code section
105A.6, to review the project. If there is a history of landslides in the
vicinity of the project, the Building Official shall require third party peer
review and establish a Structural Advisory Committee to review the project. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, ‚Äúvicinity‚Äù shall mean any property tangent
to the subject project site that also appears on the current version of the
California Department of Conservation‚Äôs Seismic Hazard Zone Map identified in
section
106A.4.1.4.3. The Building Official‚Äôs or the Building Official‚Äôs designee‚Äôs
decision(s) concerning the level of review for a particular project or activity
shall: (1) be in writing, (2) identify Departmental staff involved in the
decision, (3) be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Slope and
Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act and any Departmental guidance adopted under
section
106A.4.1.6, and (4) describe the basis for the decision.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†All such project reviews required under section
106A.4.1.4.4(a) shall verify that appropriate geological and geotechnical
issues have been considered and that appropriate slope instability mitigation
strategies, including drainage plans if required, have been proposed. Review
also shall consider any other factors relevant to mitigation slope instability,
including, but not limited to, the ground slope, soil type at the project site,
the geologic conditions, the history of landslides in the vicinity, the nature
of the planned excavation and construction, the proximity and type of adjacent
construction, and the effect that construction activity related to the proposed
project will have on the safety and stability of the subject property and
properties within the vicinity of such property.
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†No permits as specified above for properties subject to the Slope and
Seismic Hazard Zone Protection Act that involve review by the Structural
Advisory Committee shall be issued unless and until the Building Official has
consulted with and received a written communication from representatives of the
Departments of Planning and Public Works, and the Fire Department, each of whom
has made a visit to the site for which the project is proposed, and the
Building Official has received a written report from the Structural Advisory
Committee concerning the safety and integrity of the proposed design and
construction. As part of its review, the Structural Advisory Committee shall
make findings concerning the review criteria and analysis set forth in this
section
106A.4.1.4.4 and Departmental guidelines and regulations regarding slope and
seismic hazards.
106A.4.1.4.5 Mandatory denial by the Building Official. In the event that the
Building Official establishes a Structural Advisory Committee and such
Committee determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
design and construction would result in unsafe conditions or would increase the
likelihood of hillside or slope instability, and such unsafe conditions or
instability cannot be mitigated to the satisfaction of the Committee, the
Building Official shall deny the permit. The Building Official‚Äôs decision to
deny the permit is appealable only to the Board of Appeals.
106A.4.1.4.6 Regulations to implement the Slope and Seismic Hazard Zone
Protection Act. The Building Official is hereby authorized to adopt rules,
regulations, administrative bulletins, or other written guidelines to assist
the Department in implementing this Section
106A .4.1.4, provided that any such guidance shall be in addition to the
criteria set forth in section
106A .4.1.4.4 or elsewhere in this Act and shall not conflict with or diminish
any of the permit review criteria in this Building Code. Such guidance may
provide objective criteria to exempt certain projects and activities from
discretionary third party peer or Structural Advisory Committee review where
the soil at the project site is dune sand or Colma Formation and the project or
activity presents circumstances that would not necessitate more extensive
review.
106A.4.2 Retention of approved construction documents. One set of approved
construction documents shall be provided to the party obtaining the permit. The
owner shall be responsible for keeping these documents on the building site at
all times and making them available for inspection and use by the inspector
during such construction until final inspection has been made; failure to do so
shall result in stoppage of work. The approved construction documents shall not
be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the Building
Official; all work shall be done in accordance with these documents.
¬†¬†¬†One set of approved construction documents for all building permits shall be
retained by the Department in reproducible form as public records.
106A.4.3 Validity of permit. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans and
specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of,
any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of any other applicable
laws and regulations. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel
the provisions of this code or other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not
be valid.
¬†¬†¬†The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications and other data shall
not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing
building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code
or other applicable laws and regulations.
106A.4.4 Permit expiration. Every permit issued by the Building Official under
the provisions of this code, unless an extension of time has been specifically
approved by the Building Official, shall expire by limitation and become null
and void when the time allowed in Table B is reached, or when any of the
following circumstances is applicable:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†For Building Official-initiated code compliance permits, the work shall
start within 30 days from the date of such permit.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†If the building or work authorized is suspended or abandoned at any
time after the work has started, for a period as follows:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.1.¬†¬†¬†Thirty days for Building Official-initiated code compliance
permits.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.2.¬†¬†¬†One-hundred-eighty days for all other permits.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†An extension of time from the stated periods may be permitted for good
reason, provided such requests for an extension are submitted to the Building
Official in writing prior to the end of the time period accompanied by payment
of a fee. Unless approved by the Building Official, no more than one extension
of time may be granted.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.1.¬†¬†¬†For all other permits, see Table B ‚Äì Maximum Time Allowed to
Complete All Work Authorized by Building Permit. The maximum time allowed for
Building Official-initiated code compliance permits shall be 12 months for all
permits exceeding $25,000 total valuation.
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†A demolition permit shall expire 180 days after issuance. Only one
extension of time of 180 days shall be granted upon written request to the
Building Official, accompanied by payment of a fee. If there is a permit for a
replacement structure, the demolition permit shall expire concurrently with the
permit for that replacement structure.
¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†The Building Official may administratively authorize the processing of
applications involving compliance actions initiated by the Department, in a
manner other than set forth in this code, so as to effect said compliance most
expeditiously; provided, however, that due process is assured all applicants.
In this regard, the Building Official may reduce the time periods set forth in
this section as they apply to a second application and permit required by the
Building Official to effect full compliance with this code and other applicable
laws and regulations if by doing so code compliance would be more expeditiously
accomplished.
¬†¬†¬†EXCEPTION: In order to avoid repetitive filings and processing of
applications to effect code compliance, the Building Official is hereby
authorized to establish alternate procedures and extensions of time from
cancellation pursuant to Section
106A .4.1 and from expiration pursuant to this section; provided, however, that
the Building Official, in establishing alternate procedures and extension of
time, shall proceed as expeditiously as possible toward abatement of the
violations.
¬†¬†¬†When a permit is issued but delayed due to actions before the Board of
Appeals or other City agencies, or cases in any court of competent
jurisdiction, or is under review by a State or regional regulatory body, the
time allowable shall be computed from the date of the final action of the
agency or court of jurisdiction.

106A.4.4.1 Commencement of work on permit expired due to work not started.
Before work can be commenced on an expired permit on which no work was
performed, a new application shall be filed and a new permit shall be obtained.
If not more than one year has elapsed since the expiration of the original
permit, the applicant is eligible for reduced fee on the new permit. See
Section
110A ‚Äì
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Commencement of Work Not Started. All other applicable fees in
Section
110A ‚Äì
Table 1A-A or any other table in this code, shall be collected in the full
amount. To qualify for the reduced fees, the original approved plans and
specifications in the possession of the owner shall be submitted with the new
application, together with a notarized certification that there are no changes
made on those plans and specifications.
¬†¬†¬†In the event a refund has been granted upon the request of the applicant
prior to the commencement of the work, the provisions of this section shall not
apply and a new permit shall be applied for and all fees will be required to be
paid.
106A.4.4.2 Recommencement of work on permit expired due to work not completed.
An alteration permit shall be secured for the work not completed. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-F ‚Äì Specialty Permit Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee to defray cost of
certifying site conditions. The permit fee shall be based upon the valuation of
the uncompleted work. When the permit is for completing the work as shown on
the original approved plans, no additional plan review fee shall be required.
106A.4.5 Suspension or revocation. The building official may, in writing,
suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever
the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information
supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation of any of the
provisions of this code.
¬†¬†¬†Any permit issued for which less than the correct permit and plan checking
fees were paid shall be considered an invalid permit and shall be suspended
until the complete bill of fees has been paid. Failure to pay the correct fees
shall be sufficient grounds for denial of a temporary permit of occupancy or a
permit of occupancy.
106A.4.6 Notice of permit issuance. Within 24 hours after the issuance of a
building permit authorizing the types of work described below, notice of such
issuance shall be given in the manner set forth below.

relates to a vacant site or a vacant building, in which case the Building
Official may require a sign up to 8 feet (2.438 m) wide and 4 feet (1.219 m)
high upon a determination that the larger sign will provide better public
notice. If a larger sign is required, the permittee shall provide it, and it
shall contain the information set forth above. The sign required herein shall
be installed as follows: The bottom edge of the sign shall be at least 6 feet
(1.829 m) above grade; the face of the sign shall be parallel to the main

from the Planning Commission, work under a demolition permit shall not begin
until 15 days after the date on which the permit is issued.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†For a permit which would authorize a structural addition to an existing
building, the Department shall mail written notice to the owners of properties
immediately adjacent to the subject building as shown on the current tax roll.
See Section
110A,
Table 1A-L ‚Äì Public Information ‚Äì for applicable fee.

Board of Appeals or the time for filing such appeal has lapsed without an
appeal being filed. Such notice shall also include contact information for
translation services into Spanish, Chinese, and Russian.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Revocation for noncompliance. The Building Official shall, after
providing the permittee an opportunity to respond to any complaint of
noncompliance, revoke any permit where the applicant has not substantially
complied with the provisions of this section or Section
106A .3.2.3 requiring notice of permit application and issuance.
¬†¬†¬†The requirements contained in this code relating to notice are not intended
to give any right to any person to challenge in any administrative or judicial
proceeding any action for which notice is given if such person would not
otherwise have the legal right to do so.
106A.4.7 Additional work, permit required. When an approved permit has been
issued, a separate permit for alteration work shall be required for any change
in work or additional work as set forth hereafter. The fees for such additional
work shall be as set forth in Section

sufficiently to require revised plans or additional plans to be submitted to
the Department for approval, including changes in partition layout that impact
other code requirements, changes in framing directions, spans, and locations of
concentrated loads, and changes in types of materials used. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-F ‚Äì Specialty Permit Fees ‚Äì for the assessment for this type of
additional work.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Changes proposed to any building or structure which alter the exterior
dimensions more than 6 inches (152.4 mm) either in vertical or horizontal
dimension, alter the visual appearance through changes in exterior wall
materials or windows, change the number of residential dwelling units or
decrease the amount of off-street parking provided.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Value of additional work or of changes exceeding 10 percent of the
valuation of the approved permit work or $50,000 whichever is the lesser
amount.

¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†A change in the construction type of any portion of the building.
¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†An unusual condition requiring a permit procedure to protect the
interest of the public.
¬†¬†¬†A separate alteration permit shall not be required where the change or
additional work is required by the Board of Appeals as a condition of approving
an appealed permit; however, revised plans and plan review fees, including back
check fees, shall be required for any such change or additional work. The Board
of Appeals may require, as a condition of approval, that revised plans be
submitted to the Board for review.
106A.4.8 Replacement of approved construction documents. When the permit
holder‚Äôs set of approved construction documents is not available as required by
Section
106A .4.2, a duplicate set of documents shall be submitted to the Department
along with a notarized certification that such documents are identical to the
approved construction documents except for notations by City agencies. The
Department shall then copy such notations from its retained set to the
duplicate set and shall stamp the duplicate set APPROVED.
¬†¬†¬†See Section
110A,
Table 1A-L ‚Äì Public Information ‚Äì for applicable fee.
106A.4.9 Preapplication plan review or inspection. When a party wishes to
discuss specific design issues or submit preliminary designs for review and
comment by the Department prior to formal application for a permit, a request
for preapplication plan review must be submitted in writing to the Building
Official. See Section
110A ,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for applicable fees.
Payment of the minimum fee must be submitted with the letter of request.
¬†¬†¬†In cases where on-site discussion with a field inspector is desired, the
same request requirements apply. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-G ‚Äì Inspections, Surveys and Reports ‚Äì for applicable fee.
106A.4.10 Review of mechanical plans. When an application for a permit contains
a mechanical component (separate from or in addition to energy conservation
design) sufficient in scope or complexity to require review by a mechanical
specialist, a fee for this service shall be assessed and is payable before
issuance of the permit. See Section
110A ,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee.
106A.4.11 Review of electrical plans. When an application for a permit contains
an electrical component (separate from or in addition to energy conservation
design) sufficient in scope or complexity to require review by an electrical
specialist, a fee for this service shall be assessed and is payable before
issuance of the permit. See Section
110A ,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee.
106A.4.12 Review of plumbing plans. When an application for a permit contains a
plumbing component sufficient in scope or complexity to require review by a
plumbing plan reviewer, a fee for this service shall be assessed and is payable
before issuance of the permit. See Section
110A ,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee.
106A.4.13 Premium plan review. At the request of the applicant and upon payment
of an additional fee per
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit Application and Plan Review Fees, building
permit applications shall be reviewed by the Department of Building Inspection
within a guaranteed plan review time set by the Building Official. This
building plan review time will be less than normal turnaround times and will be
developed on a case-by-case basis depending on the scope of work and the
quality of completeness of the submittal documents. At or before the due date
of the guaranteed building plan review time, a thorough set of plan review
comments and/or corrections will be sent to the applicant for response. Premium
Plan Review does not guarantee plan review times during the recheck process,
nor building permit approval and issuance. If the Department fails to complete
its plan review within the guaranteed plan review time, the additional fee paid
shall be refunded to the applicant upon written request by the applicant. This
service is offered for plan review by the Department of Building Inspection
only and does not commit any other City agencies or departments to the
turnaround times.
106A.5 Awning Amnesty Program. The Department shall implement the temporary
amnesty program outlined in this Section
106A.5 to incentivize and expedite the legalization of Awnings, as defined and
regulated in Section 1703 of the Building Code, that were installed without a
building permit or for which the Department has no record of a building permit
on file as of the effective date of this ordinance in Board File No. 230477.
All property owners that have Awnings without a building permit on file are
eligible for the amnesty program, including property owners with active Notices
of Violation for installing or having an Awning without a building permit.
106A.5.1 Certification of Existing Installation: No New Construction, Repairs,
or Corrective Work. The amnesty program shall provide a streamlined process to
verify that an existing Awning complies with applicable provisions of the
Building Code as well as Planning Code Section 187.3, and will result in a
building permit authorizing the existing Awning. The amnesty program shall not
authorize new construction or corrective work to bring an existing Awning into
compliance. Any alterations, modifications, or construction required to bring
the Awning into compliance with the Building Code will require a standard
building permit and is not subject to the provisions of this Section 106A.5,
except that the fees for any such permit shall be waived pursuant to Section
106A.5.2.
106A.5.2 Waiving of Fees. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Building
Code, the Department shall waive all fees for applications eligible for the
amnesty program and for any permits required to repair or replace an Awning
that the Department determined was not in compliance with the Building Code,
including the application fee for plan review, permit issuance fee for
inspections, and any enforcement fees, including inspection fees required under
Section
107A.5 for work without a permit.
106A.5.3 Streamlined Application Process. The Department shall develop a
streamlined application process to facilitate and expedite review of Awning
permits during the amnesty program. The application shall require only
information essential to determining whether an existing Awning complies with
the applicable Building and Planning Code provisions, including the Planning
Code‚Äôs amnesty program in Planning Code Section 187.3.
106A.5.4 No Relaxation of Building Standards. The amnesty program governs the
certification of existing Awnings‚Äô compliance with applicable Building Code
provisions. Any Awning that is not in compliance with the Building Code will
require a separate building permit to repair, replace, or remove the Awning.
106A.5.5 Sunset. Unless the Board of Supervisors adopts an ordinance extending
the term of this Section
106A.5, it shall expire by operation of law on June 1, 2024. At such time, the
City Attorney shall cause it to be removed from the Building Code.

SECTION 107A ‚Äì FEES
107A.1 General. Fees shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of
this section or shall be as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by the
jurisdiction.
107A.1.2 Exemption from fees. The fees provided for in this chapter shall not
apply to permits issued to perform work on buildings which are owned and
occupied by the Federal or State governments. The San Francisco Housing
Authority shall be exempt from all permit fees in this chapter except State
mandated fees and record retention fees. Permits required under this code for
buildings and sites owned or leased by the City and County of San Francisco
shall be subject to all fees set forth in this chapter.
107A.2 Permit Issuance Fees. The minimum permit fee per Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees ‚Äì shall be paid at the time an application
for a building permit is issued. The New Construction Permit Fee Schedule
applies to new buildings or structures. The Alteration Permit Fee Schedule
applies to alterations, repairs, additions or other work on an existing
building or structure, or to the modification of the scope of an approved
permit as required by Section
106A.4.7.
¬†¬†¬†The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of this
code shall be made by the Building Official. The value to be used in computing
the permit issuance and plan review fees shall be the final valuation upon
completion of all construction work for which the permit is issued, as well as
all finish work, painting, roofing, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating,
air conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems and all other
permanently installed equipment and construction, even though other permits to
perform such work may be required.
¬†¬†¬†The valuation shall be calculated at the time of permit issuance according
to a cost schedule posted in the office of the Department or by actual
construction cost, whichever is greater. The valuation shall be recalculated at
the time of any addenda and/or revision issuance. Any additional fees due
resulting from the recalculation of valuation shall be paid prior to addenda
and/or revision issuance. The cost schedule shall be adjusted annually based on
construction cost data reported by a variety of sources, including without
limitation, local contractors, design professionals, cost estimators or
nationally published construction cost data books or websites. Contractor
overhead and profit shall be reflected in the schedule. The Building Inspection
Commission is authorized to waive the annual cost schedule adjustment if it
determines that increasing the fees will exceed the cost of providing the
services for which the fees are paid.
107A.3 Plan review fees.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†When submittal documents are required by Section
106A.3.2, a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of filing an application
for a permit for which plans are required pursuant to Section
106A.3.2. Said plan review fee shall be based on the valuation determined by
Section
107A.1. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee.
¬†¬†¬†The plan review fees specified in this section are separate fees from the
permit issuance fees specified in Section
107A.2 and are in addition to the permit fees.
¬†¬†¬†When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to require
additional plan review or when the project involves deferred submittal items as
defined in Section
106A.3.4.2, an additional plan review fee shall be charged as shown in Section
110A,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†If a project involves voluntary seismic retrofit upgrades to soft-
story, wood-frame buildings, as defined by the Building Official, the applicant
for said project shall be exempt from the proportionate share of plan review
fees specified under this Chapter that is related to such retrofit work,
provided all permit conditions and timelines are met.
107A.3.1 Reduced plan review fee. A reduced plan review fee shall be collected
for reviewing submittal documents identical to those filed within one year of
the original approved construction documents for which the full plan review fee
was paid. For this purpose, plans may be considered identical when they contain
only such minor differences as exterior finishes, or if they are identical but
opposite hand. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-B  ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for the second and
each subsequent set of identical submittal documents within the stated time
period. To obtain this reduction, the applicant shall submit a copy of the
original approved construction documents for which the full plan review fee was
paid.
¬†¬†¬†When the submittal documents are substantially changed from those that were
previously approved, an additional full plan review fee shall be charged. See
Section
110A,
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees ‚Äì for applicable fee.
107A.3.2 Tenant improvement work. An application for tenant improvement work
shall state at the time of filing whether the permit is to include the
partition and other improvement work for the entire building. If this work is
not to be included, the valuation shall be reduced accordingly. The
installation of such work shall then require permits for alteration work, the
fees for which shall be in accordance with Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees.
107A.3.3 Improvement work. When the application is for first-time improvement
work in a new building and the valuation of such work was included in the
valuation of the original building permit, the valuation for each alteration
permit for part or all of such work shall be shown as $500, and the permit fee
shall be collected accordingly.
107A.3.4 Site permit and addenda fees. The permit fee for projects submitted
under the site permit and addenda process shall be based on Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees and additional fees as stated in
Table 1A-B ‚Äì Other Building Permit and Plan Review Fees. Twenty-five percent of
the plan review fee shall be paid at the time of site permit application
submittal, and shall be credited toward the final plan review fee payment at
the time of the first construction addendum submittal as determined by the
Building Official. One hundred percent of the permit issuance fee shall be paid
at the time of the first construction addendum issuance as determined by the
Building Official.
107A.4 Expiration of plan review. (See Section
106A.3.7.)
107A.5 Investigation Fees: Work Without a Permit. Whenever any work, for which
a permit is required under the provisions of this code, has been started
without a permit and where no specific additional fees are imposed as penalties
as provided in this chapter, a special investigation shall be made before a
permit may be issued for such work. See Section
110A,
Table 1A-K ‚Äì Penalties, Hearings, Code Enforcement Assessments ‚Äì for applicable
fee. Where only a portion of the work has been commenced without a permit, the
investigation fee shall be based upon the portion of the work done without a
permit. The cost of any penalty for any work done, in conjunction with the
investigation fee, shall be borne by the owner.
¬†¬†¬†The owner or owner‚Äôs agent may appeal the amount of the investigation fee if
they can provide just cause, such as unfamiliarity with this code or
demonstrable negligence on the part of one of their employees.
¬†¬†¬†The Building Official may reduce the investigation fee to two times the
amount of the permit fee as called for in Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees ‚Äì of this code for work that was constructed
prior to the current building ownership, provided that substantiating
documentation is provided.
¬†¬†¬†Where the Building Official rules against the applicant, appeals of such
investigation fee shall be filed with the Board of Appeals in the manner
provided in Section 8¬†et seq. of the Business & Tax Regulations Code. Such
filing shall be subject to the fees and rules of the Board of Appeals. The
Board of Appeals, in reviewing the appeal of the investigation fee assessed for
doing work without a permit, may reduce the amount of said fee, but in no case
shall such reduced investigation fee be less than two times the amount of the
permit fee as called for in Section
110A,
Table 1A-A ‚Äì Building Permit Fees ‚Äì of this code.
107A.6 Fee refunds. When no work has been done and the project has been
abandoned or the permit expired per Section
106A.4.4, by limitation, a portion of the building issuance fee paid shall be
refunded upon written request of the owner when such request is made within six

2010; the project sponsor‚Äôs reapplication for a building or site permit after
expiration of the original permit and refund of the development fees paid shall
not authorize the project sponsor to elect the deferral option. The deferral
option shall expire on July 1, 2013 unless the Board of Supervisors extends it.
107A.13.3.1.1 Deposit of pre-paid portion of deferred development fees. If a
development project is not subject to one of the six neighborhood
infrastructure impact fees listed below, the pre-paid portion of the
development fees shall be deposited into the appropriate fee account. If there
is more than one fee account, the pre-paid portion of the fees shall be
apportioned equally.
¬†¬†¬†If a development project is subject to one of the six neighborhood
infrastructure impact development fees listed below, the entire 20 percent
development fee pre-payment shall be deposited in the appropriate neighborhood
infrastructure impact fee account. These pre-paid funds shall be dedicated
solely to replenishing the Neighborhood Infrastructure Seed Fund for that
specific neighborhood infrastructure impact fee account. In no event shall a
neighborhood infrastructure impact fee specific to one Area Plan be mixed with
neighborhood infrastructure impact fees specific to a different Area Plan. lf
the 20 percent development fee pre-payment exceeds the total amount owed for
the neighborhood infrastructure impact fee account, the remaining pre-paid
portion of the 20 percent development fee pre-payment shall be apportioned
equally among the remaining applicable development fees.
¬†¬†¬†The neighborhood infrastructure development fees subject to the 20 percent
pre-payment provision of this Subsection
107A.13.3.1.1 are as follows: (1) the Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure

107A.13.3.2 Payment of development fees; payment and calculation of Development
Fee Deferral Surcharge. Except for any pre-paid fees, all deferred development
fees remaining unpaid shall be paid in full prior to issuance of the first
certificate of occupancy at the end of the deferral period. The Development Fee
Deferral Surcharge shall be paid when the deferred fees are paid and shall
accrue at the Development Fee Deferral Surcharge Rate.
¬†¬†¬†The Development Fee Deferral Surcharge Rate shall be calculated monthly by
the Unit as a blended interest rate comprised of 50% of the Treasurer‚Äôs yield
on a standard two-year investment and 50% of the latest updated Monthly Earned
Income Yield Rate for the City and County of San Francisco‚Äôs Pooled Funds, as
posted on the San Francisco Treasurer‚Äôs website and 50% of the Annual
Infrastructure Construction Cost Inflation Estimate published by the Office of
the City Administrator‚Äôs Capital Planning Group and approved by the City‚Äôs
Capital Planning Committee consistent with its obligations under Section 409(b)
of the San Francisco Planning Code. The annual Infrastructure Construction Cost
Inflation Estimate shall be updated by the Office of the City Administrator‚Äôs
Capital Planning Group on an annual basis, in consultation with the Capital
Planning Committee, with the goal of establishing a reasonable estimate of
construction cost inflation for the next calendar year for a mix of public
infrastructure and facilities in San Francisco. The Capital Planning Group may
rely on past construction cost inflation data, market trends, and a variety of
national, state and local commercial and institutional construction cost
inflation indices in developing their annual estimates for San Francisco.
Commencing on the effective date of this ordinance, the Unit shall publish the
Development Fee Deferral Surcharge on the Department of Building Inspection
website at or near the beginning of each month. The accrual of any deferred
development fees begins on the first day that a project sponsor elects to defer
development fees, but never later than immediately after issuance of the first
construction document. The Development Fee Collection Unit shall calculate the
final Development Fee Deferral Surcharge for individual projects by multiplying
the total development fees otherwise due prior to issuance of the construction
document by the Development Fee Deferral Surcharge Rate by the actual day count
of the entire Development Fee Deferral Period, which shall be the number of
days between the project sponsor‚Äôs election to defer to final payment of the
deferred development fees. The Development Fee Deferral Surcharge shall be
apportioned among all development fee funds according to the ratio of each
development fee as a percentage of the total development fees owed on the
specific project.
107A.13.4 Development Fee Collection Unit. There shall be a Development Fee
Collection Unit established within the Department. The Unit‚Äôs duties include:
(1) receiving and organizing information from various City agencies concerning
the amount of development fees owed or specific development impact requirements
imposed under various sections of the San Francisco Municipal Code or other
legal authority, (2) working with the project sponsor and relevant agencies to
resolve any disputes or questions concerning the development fees or
development impact requirements applied to specific development projects, (3)
ensuring that the first construction document, or first certificate of
occupancy if the project sponsor elects to defer payment, is not issued prior
to payment of all development fees that are due and owing, (4) confirming with
the Planning Department that any outstanding development impact requirements
are satisfied prior to issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for
projects subject to such requirements, (5) generating Project Development Fee
Reports, (6) processing any development fee refunds, (7) publishing and
updating the Citywide Development Fee Register, (8) initiating lien proceedings
to collect any unpaid development impact or in-lieu fees, and (9) performing
such other duties as the Building Official requires. The fee for the

but not limited to posting it on the Department‚Äôs website.
107A.13.6 Required City Agency or Department Notice to Development Fee
Collection Unit. Prior to issuance of any building or site permit for a

collected by the Unit or imposing a development impact requirement shall send
written or electronic notification to the Development Fee Collection Unit that
(i) identifies the development project, (ii) lists which specific development
fees and/or development impact requirements are applicable and the legal
authorization for their application, (iii) specifies the amount of the
development fee or fees that the department or agency calculates is owed to the
City or that the project sponsor has elected to satisfy a development impact
requirement through the direct provision of public benefits, and (iv) lists the
name and contact information for the staff person at each agency or department
responsible for calculating the development fee or monitoring the development
impact requirement.
107A.13.7 Project Development Fee Report. Prior to the issuance of the building
or site permit for a development project that owes a development fee or fees or
is subject to development impact requirements, and at any time thereafter, the
Development Fee Collection Unit shall prepare and provide to the project
sponsor, or any member of the public upon request, a Project Development Fee
Report. The Report shall: (i) identify the development project, (ii) list which
specific development fees and/or development impact requirements are applicable
and the legal authorization for their application, (iii) specify the amount of
the development fee or fees that the department or agency calculates is owed or
that the project sponsor has elected to satisfy a development impact
requirement through the direct provision of physical improvements, (iv) list
the name and contact information for the staff person at each agency or
department responsible for calculating the development fee or monitoring the
development impact requirement, and (v) state whether the development fee or
fees are due and payable prior to issuance of the first construction document
or whether the project sponsor has requested deferral under Section
107A.13.3.1, and note the status of payment. A copy of the Project Development
Fee Report shall always be made available to the project sponsor immediately
prior to issuance of the site or building permit for a development project
subject to any development fee or fees to provide adequate notice of the
proposed development fee or fees. The Development Fee Collection Unit shall not
issue a Final Development Fee Report and the respective site or building permit
for a development project until it has received written confirmation from the
First Source Hiring Administration (FSHA) that the project sponsor has executed
a first source hiring agreement(s) with the FSHA consistent with Administrative
Code Section 83.11.
107A.13.8 Failure to give notice of a development fee owed or development
impact requirement. The failure of the Unit or a fee-assessing department or
agency to give any notice of a development fee owed or development impact
requirement shall not relieve the project sponsor of the obligation to pay the
development fee when it is due. The procedure set forth in this Section is not
intended to preclude enforcement of the development fee or development impact
requirements pursuant to any other section of this Code, the Planning Code or
other parts of the Municipal Code or under the laws of the State of California.
107A.13.9 Development fee dispute resolution; appeal to Board of Appeals.

dispute or question arises concerning the accuracy of the final Project
Development Fee Report, including the mathematical calculation of any
development fee listed thereon, the Development Fee Collection Unit shall
attempt to resolve it in consultation with the department or agency affected by
the disputed fee and the project sponsor. A person protesting the accuracy of
the Report must submit the issue or issues in writing to the Unit with a copy
to the department or agency whose development fee is in dispute. Any public
notice of the issuance of the building or site permit shall notify the public

appeal within 15 days of the issuance of the permit.
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†In order to appeal to the Board of Appeals under this Section, a
project sponsor appellant must first have attempted to resolve the dispute or
question by following the procedure in Section
107A.13.9.1. Evidence of this prior attempt must be submitted to the Board of
Appeals in order for the Board to accept the appeal. Members of the public may
file an appeal under this Section without providing such evidence.

notify the department or agency whose development fee or development impact
requirement is at issue of the fact that an appeal has been filed and the date
scheduled for hearing. A representative of the Department of Building
Inspection and of the department or agency whose development fee or development
impact requirement is in dispute must be present at the appeal hearing.
¬†¬†¬†(e)¬†¬†¬†In hearing any appeal of the Project Development Fee Report, the
Board‚Äôs jurisdiction is strictly limited to determining whether the
mathematical calculation of the development fee or the scope of a development
impact requirement is accurate and resolving any technical disputes over the
use, occupancy, floor area, unit count and mix, or other objective criteria
that calculation of the challenged development fee or development impact
requirement is based upon.
¬†¬†¬†(f)¬†¬†¬†If a decision by the Board of Appeals requires a refund of all or any
portion of the disputed development fee, the refund shall be processed promptly
by the Development Fee Collection Unit under Section
107A.13.11. If a decision requires a new determination regarding the scope of a
development impact requirement, such new determination shall be made by the
relevant City agency or department prior to issuance of the first certificate
of occupancy. Where the Board determines that an additional amount of the fee
or fees is due and owing, the additional amount shall be paid prior to issuance
of the first certificate of occupancy for the development project.

Article XX of Chapter 10 of the San Francisco Administrative Code to make the
entire unpaid balance of the fee that is due, including interest at the rate of
one and one-half percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of unpaid
fee, a lien against all parcels used for the development project. The penalty

certificate of final completion and occupancy therefor as provided herein, or
otherwise has been approved for use by the Department of Building Inspection.

occupancy. The amended certificate of final completion and occupancy shall
indicate the date the first certificate of occupancy and any subsequent
certificates of occupancy for the building or structure were issued. If there

certificate of occupancy and any subsequent certificates of occupancy for the
building or structure were issued. If there is no original certificate of
occupancy, the amended certificate of final completion and occupancy shall
refer to the date of initial construction on file in the records of the
Department.

any laws or ordinances of the City and County of San Francisco, nor shall such
issuance thereafter prevent requiring corrections of errors or of violations of
any applicable law or ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco.

SECTION 111A - ADAPTIVE REUSE
111A.1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of this Section 111A (consisting of
Sections 111A.1, 111A.2, and 111A.3) is to amend, expand, establish, and
clarify alternative building standards for the conversion of existing non-
residential buildings to accommodate new residential uses and still provide
reasonable safety to the building occupants, as a means to promote the safe,
flexible use of the existing structures, as part of the City‚Äôs strategy for
economic recovery.
¬†¬†¬†Key to the furtherance of this purpose is the ability of the Building
Official and Fire Code Official to effectively use their authority to grant
code modifications or authorizations for alternative materials, design and
methods of construction, and equipment to address practical difficulties
involved in complying with the strict provisions of the code or consider
alternative design or methods not specifically prescribed in the code.
¬†¬†¬†For example, the Building Official and Fire Code Official are authorized to
consider alternative building standards consistent with Sections 17951 and
19957 of the California Health and Safety Code.
111A.2 Scope. This Section 111A may apply to projects that meet the definition
and applicable requirements for Commercial to Residential Adaptive Reuse
projects pursuant to Planning Code Section 210.5.
¬†¬†¬†Nothing in this Section 111A shall preclude the use of the California
Historical Building Code for the conversion of a building that the Planning
Department has determined to be a qualified historic building or that may
otherwise be eligible to use the California Historical Building Code. If a
project elects to use the standards established in the California Historical
Building Code, that project shall not be permitted to use the alternative
building standards of this Section 111A.
111A.3 Compliance requirements. Generally, the San Francisco Building Code,
which adopts and amends the most recent edition of the California Building
Standards Code, applies to new construction or a change of use or occupancy.
For the conversion of existing non-residential buildings to accommodate new
residential uses, however, alternative building standards described in an
alternative building standards manual (described below) may apply.
¬†¬†¬†The Building Official and Fire Code Official shall prepare, maintain, and
update, as necessary and appropriate, an alternative building standards manual,
which shall provide the building standards applicable to Commercial to
Residential Adaptive Reuse projects as defined in Planning Code Section 210.5.
This alternative building standards manual shall include technical information
and implementation parameters, standards for determining technical
infeasibility, and alternative standards if technical infeasibility is present,
as well as other rules, requirements and procedures as the City deems
necessary, for implementing the intent of this Section 111A.
¬†¬†¬†The Building Official and Fire Code Official shall develop, as deemed
necessary and appropriate, in cooperation with other City departments and
stakeholders, information sheets, administrative bulletins, training manuals,
and educational materials to assist in the implementation of this alternative
building standards manual and this Section 111A.

202 Add this definition 1 as follows:
ALL-ELECTRIC BUILDING OR PROJECT. A building or project that uses a permanent
supply of electricity as the source of energy for all space conditioning
(including heating and cooling), water heating (including pools and spas),
cooking appliances, and clothes drying appliances. An All-Electric Building or
Project may not install natural gas or propane piping systems, fixtures or
infrastructure for those purposes in or in connection with the building,
structure, or within property lines of the premises, extending from the point
of delivery at the gas meter.
ELECTRIC-READY. A building, project, or portion thereof that contains
electrical systems and designs that provide capacity for a future retrofit of a
Mixed-Fuel Building to an All-Electric Building. Electric-Ready includes
sufficient space, drainage, electrical conductors or raceways, bus bar
capacity, and overcurrent protective devices to provide capacity for a future
retrofit to an All-Electric Building as specified in the Design Guidelines for
Electric-Ready Buildings published by the Department of Building Inspection.
KITCHEN, RESIDENTIAL. That portion in a residential dwelling unit that is a
room or area used for cooking, food storage and preparation and washing dishes,
including associated counter tops and cabinets, refrigerator, stove, ovens and
floor area.
MIXED-FUEL BUILDING. A building that uses natural gas or propane as fuel for
space heating or cooling, exterior heating, decorative uses and lighting, water
heating (including pools and spas), cooking appliances or clothes drying
appliances, onsite generation of electricity (except where primarily fueled by
onsite digestion of organic material), or contains fixtures, piping systems, or
infrastructure for natural gas or propane equipment for such uses.

SECTION 1206 ‚Äì SOUND TRANSMISSION
1206 Add the following sections:
1206.6 Definitions. The following definitions apply to Sections
1206.4 through
1206.9 of this Code.
¬†¬†¬†COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL) is a metric similar to the Ldn,
except that a 5 dB adjustment is added to the equivalent continuous sound
exposure level for evening hours (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) in addition to the 10 dB
nighttime adjustment used in the Ldn.
¬†¬†¬†DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL (Ldn) is the A-weighted equivalent continuous
sound exposure level for a 24-hour period with a 10 dB adjustment added to
sound levels occurring during nighttime hours (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).
¬†¬†¬†NORMALIZED A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL DIFFERENCE (Dn) means for a specified
source room sound spectrum, the difference, in decibels, between the average
sound levels produced in two rooms after adjustment to the expected acoustical
conditions when the receiving room under test is normally furnished.
1206.7 Exterior Sound Transmission Control.
1206.7.1 Application. Residential structures located in noise critical areas,
such as in proximity to highways, county roads, city streets, railroads, rapid
transit lines, airports, nighttime entertainment venues, or industrial areas,
shall be designed to prevent the intrusion of exterior noises beyond levels
prescribed by the Municipal Code. Proper design to accomplish this goal shall
include, but not be limited to, orientation of the residential structure,
setbacks, shielding, and sound insulation of the building.
1206.7.2 Allowable interior noise levels. Interior noise levels attributable to
exterior sources shall not exceed 45 dB in any habitable room. The noise metric
shall be either the day-night average sound level (Ldn) or the community noise
equivalent level (CNEL), whichever results in a higher measurement of noise
level.
1206.7.3 Other noise sources. Residential structures to be located where the
Ldn or CNEL exceeds 60 dB shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the
proposed design will limit exterior noise to the prescribed allowable interior
level. The Planning Department‚Äôs map titled Areas Potentially Requiring Noise
Insulations, and similar maps and guidance produced by the Planning Department,
shall be used where possible to identify sites with noise levels potentially
greater than 60 dB.
1206.8 Compliance.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†Evidence of compliance with Section
1206.7 shall consist of submittal of an acoustical analysis report, prepared
under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical
engineering, with the application for a building permit. The report shall show
topographical relationships of noise sources and dwelling sites, identification
of noise sources and their characteristics, predicted noise spectra and levels
at the exterior of the proposed dwelling structure considering present and
future land usage, the basis or bases for the prediction (measured or obtained
from published data), noise attenuation measures to be applied and an analysis
of the noise insulation effectiveness of the proposed construction showing that
the prescribed interior noise level requirements are met.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†If interior allowable noise levels are met by requiring that windows
be unopenable or closed the design for the structure must also specify a
ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable interior
environment. The ventilation system must not compromise the dwelling unit or
guest room noise reduction.
1206.9 Field Testing.
¬†¬†¬†(a)¬†¬†¬†When inspection indicates that the construction is not in accordance
with the approved design, or that the noise reduction is compromised due to
sound leaks or flanking paths, field testing may be required. A test report
showing compliance or noncompliance with prescribed interior allowable levels
shall be submitted to the building official.
¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†Field measurements of outdoor sound levels shall generally follow the
guidelines prepared by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in
ASTM E1014.
¬†¬†¬†(c)¬†¬†¬†Field measurements of the A-weighted airborne sound insulation of
buildings from exterior sources shall generally follow the guidelines prepared
by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in ASTM E966.
¬†¬†¬†(d)¬†¬†¬†For the purpose of this Section
1206.9, sound level differences measured in unoccupied units shall be
normalized to a receiving room reverberation time of one-half second. Sound
level differences measured in occupied units shall not be normalized to a
standard reverberation time.
1206.10 The Department of Building Inspection shall consult with the Planning
Department to ensure that notice to sponsors of residential development
projects affected by Sections
1206.6 through
1206.9 are provided with notice of the requirements of this Section as soon as
practicable in the project approval process.
SECTION 1208 ‚Äì INTERIOR SPACE DIMENSIONS
1208.4 Revise paragraph 1 of this section and add paragraphs 5 and 6 of this
section as follows:

SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: General Administrative Procedures
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Preparing Administrative Bulletins
               The purpose of this Administrative Bulletin is to describe the procedures to be
               used in originating, writing, editing and distributing Administrative Bulletins.
               Administrative Bulletins document the procedures to be followed by the
               Department of Building Inspection (DBI) staff and other agencies which are
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: involved with the regulatory functions of DBI. Although Administrative Bulletins
               are intended primarily for DBI use, the information may be of interest to the
               general public.
               An Administrative Bulletin differs from an Office Policy and Procedure document
               in that the latter defines DBI‚Äôs internal operating procedures and is generally
               of interest only to DBI staff.
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†Current edition of the San Francisco Building Code, Section
               104A 2.1
               The following steps are to be observed in the publishing of an Administrative
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬Bulletin. Refer to the flowchart in ATTACHMENT A. Each Administrative Bulletin
               shall be reviewed at least annually for concurrence with the current code and
               from time-to-time as necessitated by changes in policies or requirements.
¬†
1.¬†¬†¬†IDENTIFY THE PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Any individual in the Department may identify the need for an
Administrative Bulletin and report this need to the supervisor, who will in
turn discuss it with the Manager of Permit Services (the Manager). The Manager
then makes a recommendation to the Director who may give the authorization to
proceed with the writing of the Administrative Bulletin. Similarly, any City
agency may identify the need for an Administrative Bulletin directly to the
Director.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†The Manager will notify Technical Services Division (TSD) of the
subject matter and the person assigned to write the Administrative Bulletin
(the Preparer). TSD will assign the proposed Administrative Bulletin a number
and notify the Preparer to proceed.
2.¬†¬†¬†REPORT THE PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN TO BUILDING INSPECTION
COMMISSION (BIC)
¬†¬†¬†Prior to the preparation of the first draft of the Administrative Bulletin,
TSD will prepare a brief synopsis of the proposed Administrative Bulletin and
shall forward that to the DBI Director for inclusion in the Director‚Äôs Report
or Communication Item to the Building Inspection Commission (BIC).
3.¬†¬†¬†PREPARE THE DRAFT ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN
¬†¬†¬†Following such report to the BIC, the Preparer shall prepare the first
draft. The first draft is to be returned to TSD within 21 days* after BIC
review. Extensions of time may be granted by the Director under extenuating
circumstances. Such first draft shall be reviewed by the Deputy Director and
TSD for form and content, and revised as necessary. See ATTACHMENT B for the
document format which is to be followed.
4.¬†¬†¬†REVIEW THE DRAFT ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†If so requested by the BIC, the first draft shall be provided to the
BIC for public hearing prior to general distribution of the draft for review.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†If no public hearing on the first draft is requested by the BIC, that
first draft shall be distributed. The Preparer is to include a list of persons
or committees to whom the draft is recommended to be sent for review. The
Director and TSD may revise this list. (See ATTACHMENT C for a list of possible
reviewers).
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†TSD will distribute the first draft and, after a minimum 30 day* review
period, will forward any comments received to the Manager. The Manager will
review the first draft and the review comments, and if necessary, discuss them
with the Preparer. The Manager may refer the draft Administrative Bulletin to
any committee for review as seen advisable.
5.¬†¬†¬†PREPARE THE FINAL DRAFT FOR REVIEW BY THE MANAGER
¬†¬†¬†Based upon draft review comments a final draft bulletin will be prepared by
the Preparer. TSD will prepare the final draft which will then be reviewed for
form and content by the Manager.
6.¬†¬†¬†FORWARD THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN TO THE BIC FOR REVIEW AND PUBLIC
HEARING
¬†¬†¬†Following review and recommendation by the Manager and Director, the draft
Administrative Bulletin will be forwarded to the Building Inspection Commission
for review, public hearing and approval.
7.¬†¬†¬†PREPARE THE APPROVED COPY FOR PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Following BIC approval, the Preparer will have 7 days* to return a
final draft to TSD who will review the final draft for conformance to format
and prepare a final copy for signature by the Director.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†The signed Administrative Bulletin will be duplicated and distributed
as noted on a final distribution list. TSD will file the signed Administrative
Bulletin and will keep a record of the completed Administrative Bulletins in
separate indexes by:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1).¬†¬†¬†Administrative Bulletin Number
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2).¬†¬†¬†Title
* The time limits given in the procedure above are guidelines, and may vary
depending upon the complexity of the subject matter, review and approval
process, and schedule requirements. Many Administrative Bulletins result in
multiple ‚Äúdraft‚Äù stages.

SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Permit Processing and Issuance
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Priority Permit Processing Guidelines
               This bulletin establishes guidelines to assure that permit applicants receive
               equal treatment and that permits are reviewed in the order received by the
               Department of Building Inspection except for certain designated priority
               applications.
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: It is the intent of the Department of Building Inspection that the permit
               review process proceeds in an orderly, fair and efficient manner with
               sufficient flexibility to allow the reasonable resolution of problems that
               may occur on a day-to-day basis. This bulletin is issued in conjunction with
               similar bulletins from the Department of Public Works and the Planning
               Department.

               This Administrative Bulletin provides guidelines for the implementation of
               legislation adopted by the Board of Supervisors to assist City permitting
               departments in assuring that no appearance of, or actual, preferential
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬treatment is given to any permit applicant. Policy is adopted in accordance
               with the requirements of San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code
               Section 3.400, effective December 15, 2004, and supplements the Permit
               Processing Code of Conduct adopted by the Ethics Commission on January 10,
               2005.
¬†
These procedures relate to assignment, initial processing, review and issuance
of permit applications; as well as to permit revisions, deferred submittals,
and corrections submitted to the Department of Building Inspection subsequent
to initial permit application.
General Policy: In accordance with the City‚Äôs adopted ‚ÄúPermit Application
Processing‚Äù regulations, the Department of Building Inspection has determined
that there is a compelling public policy basis to provide priority review and
issuance for each of the following designated types of permit applications.
Department of Building Inspection employees are encouraged to exercise
reasonable judgment in all permit review and issuance activities in order to
fulfill our customer service responsibilities. This exercise of reasonable
judgment by employees is considered an important component in meeting the
intent of the legislation to avoid preferential treatment. In all cases when
questions arise regarding potential issues of preferential treatment, employees
are required to consult with their supervisors.
PROCEDURES
Subject to the reasonable judgment of employees, permit applications shall be
logged-in, separated into various permit types, assigned to staff for review,
and reviewed in the order in which they are received, except for certain
designated priority permits as detailed below. The Department of Building
Inspection may assign as many different permit types as necessary to assure the
efficient operation of that department. For example, the Department of Building
Inspection may separate permits for one type of work, such as office tenant
improvement construction, from other types of work, such as re-roofing or new
building construction.
Case A addresses initial permit submittal, assignment, review and issuance.
Following such initial priority action, permit applications may be placed on
hold, routed to other divisions or other City agencies, issued, cancelled, or
expired pursuant to other code requirements and other adopted policies and
procedures.
Case B addresses issues related to priority processing of permit revisions and
of other materials submitted after initial permit acceptance and review, as
well as to issues related to final processing and issuance of permits.
Case A - Applications for Permits
Permit applications for the following types of work may, upon request of the
permit applicant, be given priority assignment for plan review and issuance:

Department or Department of Building Inspection enforcement or abatement
notices which require immediate action; or
¬†¬†¬†11.¬†¬†¬†Permit applications for other work for which, in the reasonable
judgment of the Director of the Department of Building Inspection, urgent or
extraordinary circumstances exist that would lead to a significant public
benefit or necessity, when such circumstances are documented in written
findings.
Case B - Revisions and Addenda to Permits
Subject to the reasonable judgment of staff, revisions and other materials
submitted to the Department of Building Inspection during the permit review
process must be reviewed in the order in which they are received, except as
detailed below. Such submittals may include revisions, corrections, deferred
submittals, and other permit materials. Exceptions to the strict chronological
review and processing sequence are allowed and permit submittal documents may
be given priority review, upon request of the permit applicant, when any of the
following conditions is met:

Project sponsors may request the application of standard local equivalencies,
as detailed in various Administrative Bulletins, or approval of other
alternates when it can be demonstrated on a case-by-case basis that there are
practical difficulties in meeting the specific provisions of the codes, that
the modification is in conformance with the intent and purpose of the codes,
and that reasonable equivalency is provided in fire-protection and structural
integrity.
Proposed modifications may be administratively approved by the Departments if
they conform to the standard provisions of Local Equivalency. Other
modifications and applications for use of alternate materials, designs and
methods of construction may be administratively approved or may be referred to
the Board of Examiners or other review body as appropriate.
Based upon individual building and property conditions, the Department of
Building Inspection and other City departments, such as the Fire Department,
may impose requirements in addition to those proposed by the project sponsor
when approving any request for use of a standard local modification, code
modification or alternate material, design or method of construction.
Additionally, the Department of Building Inspection or any other City agency
may require that additional substantiation be provided supporting any claims
made for such proposals.
Procedure for Application for Local Equivalencies
Project sponsors wishing to apply for local equivalencies must fill out and
submit the Request for Approval of Local Equivalency form (Attachment A). Fees
are required to be paid as noted on that form.
Review Procedures for Application for Local Equivalencies
The Department of Building Inspection and the Fire Department, when applicable,
will conduct review meetings as required to consider requests for the approval
of Local Equivalencies, Modifications and Alternates. At such review meetings
each request will be either approved, approved with conditions, disapproved,
referred to another official body, or placed on ‚ÄúHold‚Äù pending submittal of
additional information. Upon approval of the local equivalency, a copy of the
signed form approving the equivalency and indicating any conditions of approval
will be attached to the submittal documents as part of the permanent record of
the project, and a copy will be sent to the project sponsor.
Please note that the Board of Examiners reviews requests for variances and
requests for approval of certain new materials, methods, and types of
construction. The Board of Examiners considers requests concerning structural
provisions related to unreinforced masonry buildings. The Access Appeals
Commission considers requests for equivalencies for issues related to disabled
access.
Appeals
Determinations of the staff of the Department of Building Inspection regarding
local equivalencies may be administratively brought for further review to the
Deputy Director and the Director of the Department of Building Inspection.
Determinations of the Director may be appealed to the Building Inspection
Commission or other designated appeal body.

               Project sponsors may request the application of this local
               equivalency allowing openings in building walls closer to
               property lines than allowed by SFBC Section 705 .8 when it can
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬be demonstrated on a case-by-case basis that there are practical
               difficulties in meeting the provisions of the code, that the
               modification is in conformance with the intent and purpose of
               the code, and that reasonable equivalency is provided in fire
               protection and structural integrity.
¬†
Such proposed modification may conform with the below listed standard
provisions. The Department of Building Inspection (DBI) and other City
departments may impose additional requirements in the approval of any request
for a code modification or alternate based upon individual building and
property conditions. Other City agencies that may review such requests include
the San Francisco Fire Department, the Planning Department and, for buildings
adjoining City-owned property, the Department of Real Estate.
If a project sponsor wishes to propose methods of opening protection different
than those listed below, proposals for the use of alternate materials, designs,
or methods of construction may be submitted for review in the same manner as
for this local equivalency. The Department of Building Inspection may require
that additional substantiation be provided supporting any claims made for such
proposals.
Procedure for Application of Local Equivalencies
Project sponsors wishing to apply local equivalencies must fill out and submit
the Request for Approval of Local Equivalency form (Attachment A). Fees to be
paid and scheduling of review of requests are as noted on that form. Following
DBI review, each request will either be approved, approved with conditions,
disapproved, or placed on Hold pending submittal of additional information.
Further details of procedures for the review of local equivalencies may be
found in
AB-005, Procedures for Approval of Local Equivalencies.
Conditions of Local Equivalencies
Openings in new building walls and new openings in existing building walls in
Groups B, M, and R occupancies that are closer to property lines than permitted
under SFBC Section 705 .8 and Table 705 .8 may be permitted on a case-by-case
basis when the following provisions or approved equivalent provisions are met
and the project sponsor provides documentation of the practical difficulties
involved in carrying out the provisions of the regular code.
The standard provisions for this Local Equivalency include all of the
following:
1.¬†¬†¬†The openings may not be used to provide required light and ventilation,
required egress, or for required emergency escape and rescue.
2.¬†¬†¬†The openings shall be fixed (non-operable) unless more than 50 feet above
the roof of any adjoining building or more than the distance prescribed for
protected openings in Table 705.8 in any direction from an adjoining building.
3.¬†¬†¬†The openings shall be located entirely above any adjoining roof or at
least six feet laterally beyond any wall of an adjoining building.
4.¬†¬†¬†The openings shall be protected with fire assemblies, such as fire
shutters or rated window assemblies, having a rating of at least 3/4 hour.
Openings in walls which have a fire-protection rating of greater than 1-hour
shall be protected by a fire assembly having a three-hour fire-protection
rating in four-hour fire-resistive walls, a two-hour fire-protection rating in
three-hour fire-resistive walls, and one-and one-half hour fire-protection
rating in two-hour fire- resistive walls. Fire shutters, if provided, shall be
actuated by smoke detectors located inside and by fusible links or other
approved devices on the outside of the protected openings.
5.¬†¬†¬†The opening shall be protected by a fire sprinkler system having ordinary
temperature, quick-response type heads installed within 18" of the openings and
spaced at 6 feet on center or at the manufacturer‚Äôs recommended minimum
spacing, whichever provides the closer spacing.
¬†¬†¬†Exception: Openings in Group R Division 3 occupancies.
6.¬†¬†¬†If the adjoining building contains R occupancy uses, proposed openings
shall not be located closer than six feet measured in any direction to any
existing opening on the adjoining building unless the adjoining owner gives
written consent. A copy of the statement giving such consent shall be attached
to the permit application.
7.¬†¬†¬†The owner of a building with such openings shall provide a recorded
statement that these openings will be closed or protected with approved fire
resistive wall construction in the event that the adjoining property is
improved in such a manner that the openings no longer comply with the
provisions of this Administrative Bulletin. A copy of a Declaration of Use
Limitation (Attachment B) shall be submitted to the plan reviewer prior to
completion of Department of Building inspection plan review.
8.¬†¬†¬†Property line openings which open onto property owned by the City and
County of San Francisco shall meet the requirements of San Francisco
Administrative Code, Article VI, Sections 23.27 through 23.30 (Attachment C).

Determinations of the staff of the Department of Building Inspection regarding
local equivalencies may be administratively brought for further review to the
Deputy Director and the Director of the Department of Building Inspection.
Determinations of the Director may be appealed to the Building Inspection
Commission or to other designated appeals bodies.
Further details of procedures for the review of local equivalencies may be
found in
AB-005, Procedures for Approval of Local Equivalencies.
Conditions of Local Equivalency
Communicating openings between new or existing buildings located on real or
assumed property lines where such openings are closer to property lines than
permitted under SFBC Section 705.8 and Table 705.8 may be permitted on a case-
by-case basis when the following provisions or other approved equivalent
provisions are met and the project sponsor provides documentation of the
practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of the regular
code.
The standard provisions for this local equivalency include:
1.¬†¬†¬†The total width of all communicating openings in a building wall shall not
exceed 25 percent of the length of the wall at the floor where the openings
occur. A single opening shall not exceed 120 square feet. Multiple openings are
permitted.
2.¬†¬†¬†Communicating openings in each building shall be protected by approved and
listed automatic-closing fire assemblies having fire protection ratings of at
least that required for the exterior wall of the building per Tables 601 and
705 .5, or for any occupancy separation required between adjoining occupancies
in the separate buildings as prescribed in Table 508.4, whichever results in a
greater fire-resistive rating. In no case shall the opening protection be less
than one-hour. Such fire assemblies shall close in the event of heat or smoke
detected on either side of the communicating opening and shall cause a local
fire alarm to sound upon closing.
3.¬†¬†¬†All vertical shafts and stairways in each building having communicating
openings shall be enclosed on the floor or floors where such communicating
openings occur, and on the floors immediately above and below where such
communicating openings occur. Enclosures shall be in accordance with SFBC Table
601 and SFBC Section 716 . Openings into such shaft and stairway enclosures
shall comply with SFBC Sections 713 and 1023 .
4.¬†¬†¬†The total combined floor area for floor connected by communicating
openings shall the basis for determination of fire sprinkler requirements in
accordance with SFBC Section
903.2.
5.¬†¬†¬†A communicating opening shall not adversely affect the lateral force
resisting capability of either building and shall not cause the transfer of
lateral forces between buildings. Calculations and details substantiating this
shall be provided.
6.¬†¬†¬†Fire protection assemblies in communicating openings shall be designed,
insofar as practical, to resist blockage and jamming in the case of seismic
events.
7.¬†¬†¬†Communicating openings shall not be used as required exits.
8.¬†¬†¬†Sprinklers for exposure protection of the openings shall be installed
within 18 inches of the openings in each building. The heads shall be of
ordinary temperature, quick-response type and be spaced at six feet on center
or at the manufacturer‚Äôs recommended minimum spacing, whichever provides the
closer spacing.
9.¬†¬†¬†The owner of each building having a communicating opening shall provide a
recorded statement that such opening(s) will be closed or protected with
approved fire-resistive wall construction in the event that either building is
altered in such a manner that the communicating openings no longer comply with
the provisions of this Administrative Bulletin. A copy of a Declaration of Use
Limitation (Attachment B) shall be submitted to the plan reviewer prior to
completion of Department of Building inspection plan review.
A permit application and related submittal documents shall detail all
construction which is approved as a result of this request for local
equivalency. No work to create a communicating opening between buildings shall
be done prior to approval of such permit application and issuance of a permit.

               The intent of this bulletin is to establish procedures to allow
               project sponsors for qualified historic buildings and properties
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬to request alternatives to the regular disabled access
               regulations through the application of the provisions of the
               State Historical Building Code.
Materials related to the application of alternative provisions must be provided
by the project sponsor to the Department of Building Inspection for review of
each specific request to apply the State Historical Building Code. Included
must be complete documentation citing the appropriate code sections and
providing the following information:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Documentation that the building or property is a qualified historical
building or property within the terms and definitions of the State Historical
Building Code. Such qualification is to be in accordance with the policies and
procedures developed by the Department of Building Inspection and the Planning
Department.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Information indicating how strict compliance with the disabled access
provisions of the San Francisco Building Code would threaten or destroy the
historic significance or character defining features of the building or
property. Each specific item for which an exception is requested must be
specifically identified and justified.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†A clear statement of each of the alternative(s) to be applied from the list
of the State Historical Building Code, Sections 8-602 and 8-603. Note that the
alternative provisions listed in the State Historical Building Code are not a
comprehensive listing of all possible alternatives. The appellant may identify
other reasonably equivalent alternatives to the regular code which would result
in access to and use by persons with disabilities.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Plans, photographs and other visual documentation for inclusion into the
file so that the conditions are clearly understandable by reviewers.
The prevailing San Francisco Building Code provisions for disabled access apply
to all buildings regardless of historical status unless it can be demonstrated
on a case-by-case basis that compliance with the prevailing code would threaten
or destroy the historical significance or character defining features of a
building or property.
Procedure for Review
¬†¬†¬†1a.¬†¬†¬†The building permit application and accompanying documentation
proposing listed Alternative Provisions or equivalent facilitation shall be
routed to Plan Review Services Divisions for review to determine if standard
administrative approval of an unreasonable hardship request can be granted.
¬†¬†¬†1b.¬†¬†¬†Alternatively, a pre-application plan review meeting may be requested
prior to permit submittal by the project sponsor to determine the applicability
of Alternative Provisions or equivalent facilitation under the State Historical
Building Code.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†If standard administrative approval cannot be granted, the request for
approval of the proposed Alternative Provisions or equivalent facilitation,
along with accompanying supporting documentation, should be sent to Plan Review
Services Division Manager for review.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†For those items which are not specifically listed as Alternative
Provisions under Sections 8-602 and 8-603, documentation to be provided by the
project sponsor to the Department of Building Inspection, Plan Review Services
shall contain written documentation including the opinions and comments of
representative local groups of persons with disabilities, persons knowledgeable
about historic preservation, and other qualified individuals regarding the
issue in question. Alternatively, or to supplement such comments, the
Department of Building Inspection may hold its own public review with other
representative persons with disabilities, in addition to other qualified
persons, should it choose to do so. Any person who meets the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) definition of ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù may be represented for these
purposes.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†[Note: Under the ADA, an individual with a disability is a person who has
a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the
person‚Äôs major life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is
regarded as having such an impairment.]
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Based on the information submitted, as well as other information
available to the Department of Building Inspection from the Planning Department
and other resources, an administrative decision will be issued by DBI approving
or denying the request, or a request for additional information will be made
within a reasonable period of time.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†A disagreement with the decision of Department of Building Inspection
staff may, on request, be reviewed through the supervisory chain, to the
Director of the Department of Building Inspection. A project sponsor wishing to
appeal the administrative decision of the Department of Building Inspection
staff and Director may appeal to the Access Appeals Commission (AAC).
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†The appellant may appeal the decision of the AAC to the State
Historical Building Safety Board. The subject of the appeal must first be
determined by the State Historical Building Safety Board to be of statewide
significance. This final administrative appeal is available to confirm that the
local agency has rendered a decision which is consistent with statewide
interpretations of the disabled access codes and the State Historical Building
Code.

AB-015 Allowable Temporary Interruptions to Disabled Access
¬†
NO. AB-015¬†¬†¬¬†
DATE¬†¬†¬†:    September 16, 1998 (Updated 1/1/2023 for code references)
SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Disabled Access
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Allowable Temporary Interruptions to Disabled Access
               The purpose of this bulletin is to establish guidelines for approval of
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: conditions which might pose temporary interruptions in disabled access to
               certain areas in new or existing buildings. This bulletin further defines
               required maintenance of disabled access features.
               Current edition of the San Francisco Building Code
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Section 1.1.7, Order of precedence and use
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section 1.9.1, Division of the State Architect - Access Compliance
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section 11B-108, Maintenance of Accessible Features
               It is the intent of this bulletin to identify specific conditions which
               might permit temporary, isolated interruptions in disabled access due to
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬maintenance and repair and in testing or emergency conditions. Such
               permissible interruptions in access do not supersede requirements for the
               installation and maintenance in good working order of features and devices
               necessary to provide access to persons with disabilities.
¬†
Certain construction and features which typically comply with all access
requirements may result in decreased access when testing or emergency
conditions arise or when normal or unanticipated maintenance is required.
Typical of these conditions is fire doors which are on magnetic, smoke-
detector-actuated hold-opens which close upon testing of fire alarm systems or
the operation of emergency systems. It is the intent of this bulletin to permit
the use of devices which provide normal accessible features without requiring
full access under emergency conditions.
Where the following specific conditions are met, the Department of Building
Inspection will allow routine approval of normally accessible features with the
understanding that in times of emergency or isolated temporary interruption
such features may not provide full compliance with all access regulations.
Specific allowable temporary interruptions in access include but are not
limited to the following features and conditions, which may be incorporated
into the design of buildings and facilities:
1.¬†¬†¬†Elevator lobby smoke doors and corridor, lobby, and other doors on
permanently-installed ‚Äúhold-open‚Äù devices when, during activation due to
testing, service, or emergency, such doors do not provide full strike-side
clearances.
2.¬†¬†¬†During the normal maintenance or repair of accessible features as required
by the San Francisco Building and Housing Codes. If access is to be interrupted
for an extended period of time, the length of interruption shall be posted and,
where possible, alternative means of access shall be provided.
The Department of Building Inspection may administratively grant unreasonable
hardship requests for permanent construction that might limit access to persons
with disabilities during such periods as described. Project applicant should
submit the necessary Unreasonable Hardship Form and indicate the specific
nature of the request for review by the Department of Building Inspection.

AB-017 Exception to Requirements for Disabled Access to Vacant Spaces

SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Disabled Access
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Exception to Requirements for Disabled Access to Vacant Spaces
               The purpose of this bulletin is to establish guidelines for provision of
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: accessibility to vacant and to subsequently occupied or re-occupied spaces
               or buildings.
               Current edition of the San Francisco Building Code
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Section 1.9.1, Division of the State Architect - Access Compliance
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section
               103A, Violations
               The Department of Building Inspection (DBI) through this bulletin intends
               to assure the compliance with requirements for accessibility to spaces
               used and occupied by persons with disabilities and other persons, while
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬affirming that buildings or portions of buildings which are not occupied
               for any use or purpose do not require access. This bulletin further
               addresses issues of accessibility upon re-occupancy of buildings where
               existing violations have been cited by DBI, and confirms that access
               requirements must be met before either temporary or permanent occupancy.
¬†
In order to avoid the costly provision of disabled access features for spaces
where tenant improvements have not yet been fully incorporated for future use,
or where the temporary solution to disabled access complaints may be to vacate
a non-complying space, the Department of Building Inspection acknowledges that
there are no requirements to provide disabled access to such vacant space. When
vacant spaces become occupied or re-occupied, all disabled access features must
be provided as required under the San Francisco Building Code. New buildings,
particularly those core-and-shell buildings where tenant spaces have not yet
been occupied, may be granted exceptions from some specific interior access
requirements but must meet all basic site access requirements so that
construction does not preclude subsequent access compliance. Buildings actively
under construction or renovation which are not occupied for other purposes also
need not be provided with disabled access features.
Where a vacant building or space is subject to a complaint or abatement action
for failure to provide required disabled access features, such access features
need not be provided until the space is reoccupied. Prior to reoccupancy, a
building permit is required to correct accessibility violations, even if no
other tenant improvement or other construction work is contemplated. It is the
responsibility of the owner to provide no less than quarterly updates to the
Department of Building Inspection regarding the status of vacant buildings upon
which complaints are outstanding. Such reports shall be provided to the
Disabled Access Division of the Department of Building Inspection and signed by
the owner or their representative.
Note that the San Francisco Building Code specifically requires access to
temporary and emergency buildings and facilities. Any use of otherwise vacant
spaces, such as temporary office space or other special use, requires
compliance with disabled access regulations per San Francisco Building Code
Section 1.9. Temporary uses may be provided with temporary disabled access
features with the approval the Department of Building Inspection (i.e.,
temporary accessible toilet facilities).

               that there are practical difficulties in meeting the provisions
               of the SFBC, that the modification is in conformance with the
               intent and purpose of the SFBC, and that reasonable equivalency
               is provided in fire-protection and structural integrity.
¬†
Such proposed modification may be approved by the Department if it conforms
with the below listed standard provisions. The Department of Building
Inspection and other City departments may impose additional requirements, in
addition to those listed below, in the approval of any request for a code
modification or alternate based upon individual building and property
conditions. The San Francisco Fire Department may also review such case-by-case
requests.
If a project sponsor wishes to propose means of egress which differ from those
listed below, proposals for the use of alternate materials, designs, or methods
of construction may be submitted for review in the same manner as for this
Local Equivalency. The Department of Building Inspection may require that
additional substantiation be provided supporting any claims made for such
proposals.
Procedure for Application of Local Equivalencies
Project sponsors wishing to apply local equivalencies must fill out and submit
the Request for Approval of Local Equivalency Form. Fees to be paid and
scheduling of review are as noted on that form. Following DBI review, each

SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Plan Review; Permit Process
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Crane Site Safety Plan and Building Permits
               The purpose of this Administrative Bulletin is to detail
               procedures regarding tower crane safety which comply with the
               intent of the latest edition of the San Francisco Building Code
               Section
               1705.23.
               Implementation of the intent of the code requires that a
               contractor identify the location of proposed crane operations on
               a Crane Site Safety Plan and agree to comply with all applicable

PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: safety representative during tower crane erection, jumping, and
               dismantling, and to prohibit, without prior agreement with the
               City and County of San Francisco, the controlling contractor and
               the crane erector, these operations from taking place during
               high traffic hours; to require employment of a flag-person to
               redirect traffic when loads are lifted over public streets and
               walkways during high traffic hours; and to require the review,
               approval and permitting by the Department of Building Inspection
               of the structural elements of tower crane foundations and tie-in

               erection, dismantling, operation, tests / examination of
               equipment and accessory gear
               Following a tower crane collapse in November 1989, the State of
               California passed legislation regulating certain tower crane
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬operations. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved an
               ordinance, based on that state legislation that added a section
               regarding tower crane safety requirements to the San Francisco
               Building Code (SFBC).
¬†
Crane safety remains under the jurisdiction of the California Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA), which requires an erection permit
prior to the construction of foundation, anchorage and the erection of a tower
crane. A Cal/OSHA operational permit is also required prior to the crane
operation. While the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection (DBI) has
no direct authority over, and its employees have no expertise in, the
regulation of tower cranes, the following forms and procedures were developed
to administer the San Francisco Building Code requirements.
Definitions
For the purposes of this Administrative Bulletin, the following definitions
apply:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Contractor is the building contractor, licensed by the State of
California, responsible for tower crane site safety for the project.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†High traffic hours means weekdays from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 4:00 PM to
6:00 PM, excluding holidays.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Tower crane is a crane in which a boom, swinging (slewing) jib or other
structural member is mounted on a vertical mast or tower, and includes the
following subcategories as defined by Cal/OSHA General Industry Safety Orders,
Article 91, 4885(V)(1- 4):
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Tower crane (climber) is a crane that may be raised or lowered to
different floors or levels of the building or structure, that is erected upon,
near to, and/or supported by a building or other structure.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Tower crane (free standing) is a crane with a horizontally swinging
or luffing boom which may be on a fixed base or mounted on rails and not
attached to any other structure.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Tower crane (mobile) is a tower crane which is mounted on a crawler,
truck or similar carrier for travel or transit.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Tower crane (self-erector) is a mobile tower crane that is truck-
carrier mounted and capable of self-erection.
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Jumping (climbing) a crane is the process of increasing or decreasing
the height of a tower crane by raising the upper (slewing) section and
inserting or removing modular tower sections beneath it.
¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†Safety Representative shall mean a safety representative of the crane
manufacturer, distributor, or a representative of a licensed crane certifier,
per Cal/OSHA requirements.
General Requirements
This Administrative Bulletin shall apply to climber tower cranes and to free
standing tower cranes; mobile tower cranes and self-erector tower cranes are
exempt from these regulations, but must meet all other Cal/OSHA requirements.
A Crane Site Safety Plan and Building Permit Application (Form 3) for the tower

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Noise Insulation Enforcement Procedures
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: Enforcement of State mandated noise insulation requirements for
               new residential buildings

               Gypsum Association, 22nd Edition
               There has been some confusion and variations among Department
               personnel on the enforcement of Title 24 requirements for noise
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬insulation. This bulletin consolidates current Department
               procedures and policies on the subject, and supersedes all
               previous interpretations and procedures.
¬†
The State regulations deal only with insulation against airborne noises such as
caused by stereos and loud conversations (the STC rating), and against impact
noises such as those caused by walking or scraping a chair on a hard floor
surface (the IIC rating). The criteria for compliance consists solely of
meeting the prescriptive requirement of 50, or the field test requirement of
45.
There are many other sources of noise which could be significant irritants to
building occupants, but which the regulations do not cover. DBI does not follow
through on complaints about such noise sources. Examples include appliance
noises, such as from garbage disposals, dishwashers and washing machines;
mechanical equipment noises, such as from garage door openers, elevators and
compressors; and plumbing system noises, such as from water hammer, flushing
toilets and running water.
When there is doubt as to whether the completed building complies with the STC
and IIC ratings, the Department can require the owner to obtain and pay for
field testing to verify values of 45 or higher before a CFC is issued.
Inspectors must discuss the situation with the Chief Inspector before requiring
testing.
If a complaint is made to DBI over alleged non-compliance with STC or IIC
requirements in a new building, DBI may require the owner to have field testing
performed, but only after the complainant posts a bond to cover the cost of
testing. In the event the test results show compliance (45 or higher), the cost
of the testing must be paid by the complainant. If the tests show non-
compliance, the owner will be required to take measures to increase the ratings
to 45, and to pay for the testing and retesting.
Field testing is performed to applicable provisions of ASTM E90, E413, and
E492. The testing agency and procedures must be pre-approved by DBI.
APPLICABILITY
The noise insulation requirements apply only to residential use buildings for
which permits were applied after August 22, 1974, i.e. to Form 1 and 2
applications. They do not apply to buildings constructed before 1974 in which
new units are created through alterations, additions or changes of use.
REQUIREMENTS
1.¬†¬†¬†Wall and floor-ceiling assemblies which separate living units or guest
rooms from each other, or from common areas of the building such as hallways
and garages, must meet a Sound Transmission Class (STC) of 50.
2.¬†¬†¬†Floor-ceiling assemblies must meet an Impact Insulation Class (IIC) of 50.
PLAN CHECKING PROCEDURE
The Plan Reviewer shall do and/or obtain the following:
1.¬†¬†¬†Check that every party wall and party floor-ceiling on the floor plans are
referenced to cross-sections which clearly show the construction of the
assemblies. Give specific attention to areas with dropped ceilings and luminous
ceilings.
2.¬†¬†¬†Check the Catalog of STC & IIC Ratings, prepared by the State of Office of
Noise Control, the Fire Resistance and Sound Control Design Manual, prepared by
the Gypsum Association, and/or other standards, to see if a comparable wall
assembly has an STC of 50 or higher. If an assembly has been accepted by the
Department through the product approval process, check the approval or its file
for possible STC ratings. Where no comparable assembly is found, the plan
reviewer may estimate the STC rating by comparing the assembly against a listed
assembly which appears to have slightly more mass and/or insulation features,
and with another assembly which has less. In this manner, it is often possible
to extrapolate an STC for a listed assembly. Before doing so, plan reviewer
should have studied the listings in the Catalog of STC & IIC Ratings the Fire
Resistance Design Manual, or other standards, sufficiently to understand how
mass and/or insulation features affect the STC ratings. Where such estimates
cannot be made with a fairly high degree of confidence, the plan reviewer
should ask the designer to either revise the plans to use a listed assembly
with an STC of 50 or higher, or to provide test reports for the shown assembly
which justify ratings of 50 or higher.
3.¬†¬†¬†Floor-ceiling assemblies should be checked in a manner similar to Step 2
for an IIC rating of 50 or higher. If the IIC is achieved through the use of
carpet and padding, the plans must be annotated to indicate which areas require
them, and that the installation of carpets is mandatory.
4.¬†¬†¬†The plans must be annotated to require the following:
¬†¬†¬†-¬†¬†¬†The bottom plate in party walls must be caulked.
¬†¬†¬†-¬†¬†¬†Penetrations or openings in party walls and floor-ceilings for piping,
electrical switches and outlets, recessed light fixtures, recessed cabinets,
bathtubs and ducts must be sealed, lined, insulated, or otherwise treated to
maintain the required ratings.
¬†¬†¬†-¬†¬†¬†Dwelling unit entrance doors from interior corridors, together with
their perimeter seals, must attain an STC of 30 or higher.
5.¬†¬†¬†Check that electrical switches and outlets in party walls are not
installed back-to-back in the same stud space. Check that recessed light
fixtures are not installed in party floor-ceilings unless such devices are
boxed in with materials equivalent to the surface materials, and further that
the joints in such boxes, and openings for wiring, are caulked. Check that
recessed medicine cabinets have not been installed in party walls. Check that
the bottom plate in party walls are caulked. For bathtubs located adjacent to
party walls, check that sheetrock or wall covering extend below the top edge of
the tub down to the floor.
6.¬†¬†¬†When buildings on adjacent lots have common courts or light wells, and
both buildings have windows opening onto them, the windows must be located at
least 3 feet from the common property line (i.e. 6 feet between edges or faces
of windows). Alternatively, special acoustical treatment may be provided which
will attain STC 50 (or 45 if field tested).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
The Building Inspector in the Building Inspection Division (BID) shall do the
following:
1.¬†¬†¬†Pay specific attention to the construction of party walls and party floor-
ceilings during the frame inspection to see that materials, sound blankets,
dimensions, clearances, etc. are as shown on the sections of the approved
plans. Check that luminous or dropped ceilings will not be installed in party
floor-ceilings unless they are shown on the approved plans.
¬†¬†¬†If changes were made from the approved plans, the Inspector may accept the
as-constructed assembly only if he or she can find a very similar assembly
listed in the Catalog of STC & IIC Ratings, prepared by the State Department of
Health Services Office of Noise Control or the Fire Resistance and Sound
Control Design Manual, prepared by the Gypsum Association. Failing that, the
inspector should make a sketch of the as-built assembly and refer it to the
plan reviewer for review. Meanwhile, the inspector shall not approve the frame
inspection. If the contractor does not want to be delayed by such a review, or
if the plan reviewer concludes the as-built assembly will not meet an STC or
IIC of 50, the Inspector should inform the contractor of the option to alter
the construction to comply, or to test the completed building for ratings of
45. If the contractor decides to test, he or she must notify the Inspector in
writing. Inform the contractor that if the testing shows non-compliance, the
cost of correction would likely be much higher at that stage than at the frame
stage.
2.¬†¬†¬†Check that electrical switches and outlets in party walls are not
installed back-to-back in the same stud space. Check that recessed light
fixtures are not installed in party floor-ceilings unless such devices are
boxed in with materials equivalent to the surface materials, and further that
the joints in such boxes, and openings for wiring, are caulked. Check that
recessed medicine cabinets have not been installed in party walls. Check that
the bottom plate in party walls are caulked. For bathtubs located adjacent to
party walls, check that sheetrock or wallcovering extend below the top edge of
the tub down to the floor.
3.¬†¬†¬†Interior hallway doors are required to be 20 minutes rated (i.e. solid
core). Thus they may be presumed to meet the STC 30 rating. However, check that
the perimeter seals are in place before final inspection.

               information and may not always be accepted by the Department of
               Building Inspection plan reviewer or supervisor who has been
               assigned to check the submittal documents for a project. Rather
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬than wait for the plan review to reveal requirements of specific
               design issues, it may be advantageous to project sponsors to
               verify code requirements with a formal DBI interpretation prior
               to completion of project drawings and before submitting an
               application for a building permit or an addendum to a Site
               Permit.
¬†
This bulletin sets out the procedure for requesting, conducting and concluding
such a Pre-application or Pre-Addendum Plan Review Meeting. It is not intended
that a general, non-directed plan review of a project will be made during this
meeting, but that specific code issues will be addressed and resolved. Formal
written confirmation of decisions agreed upon will be issued to the project
sponsor following the meeting.
Request For Pre-Application or Pre-Addendum Plan Review Meeting
1.¬†¬†¬†Submit requests for a pre-application or pre-addendum plan review meeting
in writing as follows:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†List the items to be reviewed in the form of specific questions. The
applicant shall propose a solution or provide a statement of position regarding
each question asked, and shall include pertinent code references. Each item
should be numbered. This list of questions or items will then form the agenda
for review and response.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Include applicable drawings, documents, and other information as
necessary to describe the conditions under question.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†On the submitted drawings, highlight or ‚Äúcloud‚Äù the areas to be
reviewed, and provide cross-references to the questions. Where questions
pertain to means of egress, indicate the path of egress on the drawings with
arrows.
2.¬†¬†¬†To cover fees, include a check made out to the Department of Building
Inspection (See FEES below).
3.¬†¬†¬†Address requests to:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Manager, Permit Services

4.¬†¬†¬†Provide several acceptable meeting times of your choice. Allow at least 10
working days for a response to the request for a meeting appointment.
Meeting and Response
5.¬†¬†¬†The Manager of Plan Review Services will assign your pre-application or
pre-addendum plan review request to one of the following section supervisors:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Structural Plan Review
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Mechanical Plan Review
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Premium Plan Review
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Other Department staff as required
6.¬†¬†¬†The request for a pre-application or pre-addendum plan review meeting may
result in a meeting or it may result in a letter of response, if that is
determined to be appropriate by the responsible Supervisor.
7.¬†¬†¬†The review will be conducted by the Supervisor of the appropriate section
or by other staff as assigned. One or more plan reviewers from Department of
Building Inspection staff may be assigned to participate in the pre-application
or pre-addendum plan review meeting depending on the complexity of the project
and the issues raised. When necessary, representatives from other agencies such
as the San Francisco Fire Department, Department of Public Works, Department of
Public Health, Planning Department, or the Redevelopment Agency may be
requested to attend.
8.¬†¬†¬†The Department representative will have final authority to determine which
questions are addressed. Questions which are determined to be too broad in
scope may be deleted from the agenda. Discussion will be limited to the items
on the agenda.
9.¬†¬†¬†The Department may request additional information from the project sponsor
in preparation for a pre-application or pre-addendum plan review meeting or as
a follow-up to such a meeting.
10.¬†¬†¬†At the beginning of a meeting the project sponsor will be advised of the
time allowed before additional plan review fees will be charged. A typical pre-
application or pre-addendum plan review meeting, depending on the complexity of
the project or issue, can be covered adequately in 2 hours or less of meeting
time.
11.¬†¬†¬†A Department of Building Inspection staff member or the project sponsor
will be designated to take notes during the meeting. If the size or location of
the meeting warrants, the Department representative may request that a third
party take the notes. Notes shall be taken on a standard form provided by DBI.
At the conclusion of the meeting a copy of the notes taken during the meeting
will be provided to the principal attendees. Those notes, which record the
findings and agreements of the meeting, are to be signed by a Department of
Building Inspection representative, by representatives of other departments as
applicable, and by the project sponsor. Questions or topics not acknowledged in
these notes will not be considered as part of the pre-application or pre-
addendum plan review agreements. Alternatively, the Department may choose to
issue a letter following the meeting. Such letter or other written
communication shall be prepared by Department staff or the project sponsor
within 10 working days of the conclusion of the meeting. Within 10 working days
of receipt of such letter, the DBI staff will review and return the letter,
signed, as ‚Äúapproved,‚Äù ‚Äúapproved with conditions,‚Äù or ‚Äúdisapproved.‚Äù The letter
shall state the reasons for such determinations. DBI will track the time of
issuance and approval of such letters to confirm that the above time limits are
met.
12.¬†¬†¬†For clarity, each item number of the written response shall correspond to
the item number on the agenda.
13.¬†¬†¬†Any notes, annotated drawings and other documents from the meeting may be
attached to the notes or letter of agreement and submitted by the project
sponsor for reference at the time of permit or addendum application.
14.¬†¬†¬†The project sponsor shall attach a copy of the signed conclusions of the
pre-application or pre-addendum plan review meeting, or the letter of response
in lieu of meeting, to the permit application or addendum drawings. These
decisions will be honored by the responsible plan reviewer during the plan
review process and subsequently by field inspection staff.
15.¬†¬†¬†The project sponsor may request a review of the determination of the
staff of the Department of Building Inspection by the Manager of Plan Review
Services or the Director. Determinations of the Director may be appealed to the
Building Inspection Commission. Certain issues related to alternate methods and
materials and technical equivalencies may be appealed to the Board of
Examiners.
16.¬†¬†¬†In the event the code provisions referenced by the application are
substantively revised prior to filing for permit, the applicant will be
required to submit for a new pre-application plan review meeting.
FEES:
17.¬†¬†¬†Fee Schedule:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Fees for initial and each subsequent meeting for a pre-application or
pre-addendum plan review meeting are as noted in the latest edition of the San
Francisco Building Code Fee Schedule,
Table 1A-B, Item 5, Pre-application Plan Review Fee. This fee covers a review
of the submitted documents, research, formulating a response, and the meeting
itself. The meeting time shall not exceed a total of two hours under this base
fee.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Additional meeting time beyond two hours for both pre-application and
pre-addendum meetings is to be charged on a per person, hourly basis per San
Francisco Building Code,
Table 1A-D, Item 1.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†The San Francisco Fire Department charges plan review fees in addition
to the above fees when Fire Department personnel are included in a meeting.
18.¬†¬†¬†Fees, in addition to the pre-application plan review fee paid in advance,
will be calculated at the conclusion of the meeting. Notes or letters of
agreement will not be released by the Department until all pre-application or
pre-addendum plan review fees are paid.
19.¬†¬†¬†If the initial pre-application or pre-addendum plan review fee is paid
but no such meeting is subsequently held and no preparatory work has been done,
the fee may be refunded upon written request by the project sponsor and
agreement by the Department.

               The San Francisco Building Code (SFBC) under Section
               106A.3.4.2 allows the application for, and the issuance of, a
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬SITE PERMIT. This permit is issued upon the review and approval
               of conceptual design drawings and related specifications and
               documentation.
¬†
Construction work at the site is controlled and scheduled through the Site
Permit process by the submission and approval of a series of segmented phased
construction plans identified as addenda. Plans submitted under each addendum
shall clearly contain details sufficient to enable plan review, fabrication in
the field, and inspection confirmation. Only work shown on approved addenda
plans bearing the Department ‚ÄúStamp of approval‚Äù as specified in SFBC Section
106A.4.1 shall be permitted to proceed at the site. Those approved addenda
plans and specifications shall be kept available on the site per SFBC Section
106A.4.2 for the use of the inspectors. It is recommended that subcontractors
check their shop drawings with the approved addenda kept on site to confirm
that their portion of the work has been approved.
Work in progress beyond that shown on the approved addendum or addenda or the
failure to display and make available the approved plans at the site shall
result in stoppage of work.
1.¬†¬†¬†DEFINITIONS (See Section 7 for additional information)
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Grading Addendum. This package shall include grading, excavation, and
shoring drawings; shoring calculations, completed special inspection and
observation form; and geotechnical review letter and report. Grading is defined
by Appendix J in the San Francisco Building Code. Permanent cantilever
retaining walls may be included, if not part of the building, when clearly
shown and completely detailed on the plans. Excavation, shoring, lagging and
bracing may be included as part of this addendum, or under separate permit.
When tie-back anchors extend onto adjoining property, formal written permission
granted by the adjoining owner is required. A separate permit is required for
underpinning of each building on adjoining property. The Site Permit applicant
is cautioned to provide reasonable notice to adjoining owners of intent to
excavate per California Civil Code Section 832. Demolition of buildings on the
site will require separate permits per SFBC Section
106A.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Foundation Addendum. This addendum includes piles, pile caps, spread
footings, line footings, grade and tie beams, and slabs on grade and
underground utilities as applicable. Cantilever retaining and basement walls
not more than one story above grade may be included when clearly shown on the
plans. Suspended slabs not more than one story above grade may be considered as
part of the foundation addendum when no structural steel work is included.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Superstructure Addendum. Work for this addendum includes the erection
of the basic building and structural frame, providing fireproofing,
constructing floors, structural wall systems, stairs and stair shafts.
¬†¬†¬†The exterior skin shall be included for structural and energy compliance.
Structural details and calculations for fabrication, erection and fastening
shall be provided. Loading points on beams, girders and columns shall be
considered, support details designed, and shown on the drawings. California
Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 24, Part 6, energy compliance shall be
submitted, but only the building envelope will be approved under this addendum.
Building envelope details must be confirmed with CCR Title 24, Part 6
documentation.
¬†¬†¬†Unless the Mechanical and Electrical System addendum is incorporated with
the Super-structure addendum, mechanical and electrical systems shall only
include partial installations limited to riser or portions of systems that are
physically restrained and locked in by the construction of the building
structure. Only stub-outs from riser trunk lines to receive connections from
lateral branch lines may be installed under this addendum. Standpipes shall be
installed per SFBC Section
905 during erection for purposes of fire protection. These works are permitted
but will not be approved unless calculations and supportive documentation are
submitted for plan check review and accepted.
¬†¬†¬†Lateral or branch lines, ducts, piping, wiring, machinery and equipment
installation are not permitted nor approved until the Mechanical and Electrical
System addendum, but may be shown and included in the Superstructure addendum
plan submittal and need not be masked out. If such work is shown on this
addendum, there shall be a general note on the cover sheet of the set stating
‚ÄúNo installation of lateral electrical or mechanical lines‚Äù or some such
equivalent statement. Exceptions requiring installation shall also require
documentation review and shall be declared and described in the approved
addenda schedule and noted specifically as an exception on the plans under the
general note previously mentioned prohibiting such installation. Extensive use
of such exceptions shall be accommodated through combining the Mechanical and
Electrical System addendum into the Superstructure addendum. All mechanical and
electrical work must have related plumbing and electrical permits. Closure for
walls, floors and shafts where mechanical and electrical systems are installed
shall only occur after proper inspection and approval.
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Mechanical & Electrical Systems Addendum - Including Life Safety. This
addendum includes all of the mechanical and electrical work within the building
except that inclusive in the Superstructure and the Final addendum. Typical
work includes the sprinkler systems, HVAC systems, smoke evacuation and control
systems, emergency lighting and power, fire alarms and warning device systems,
voice enunciation and communication systems, boilers, lighting, and central
control station installation.
¬†¬†¬†Full design plans including energy calculations and acoustic report if
applicable are to be submitted. Where schematic plans are submitted, typical
details for installation should be provided. For example, typical hangers,
struts, sleeves, packing and seismic restraints should be shown for sprinkler
system installations. Full documentation shall be submitted for review at this
time. Included as part of this documentation will be the compliance as required
by SFBC
Chapter 16 for seismic consideration for those systems shown.
¬†¬†¬†e.¬†¬†¬†Final Addendum. This addendum includes all work excluded under the
Superstructure and the Mechanical and Electrical system addenda.
¬†¬†¬†f.¬†¬†¬†Addendum is the grouping of desired work into one single phase of
construction.
¬†¬†¬†g.¬†¬†¬†Addenda is the plural of addendum. (See Section 6 for Addenda Submittal
and Section 8 for Processing of Site Permit Addenda).
¬†¬†¬†h.¬†¬†¬†Addenda Schedule is the proposed division of work into a logical
sequence of addenda that aligns with the project‚Äôs construction sequences that
collectively carries it through to completion. (See Section 7 for Approval of
Sequence of Partial Construction Phases).
¬†¬†¬†i.¬†¬†¬†Approved Addenda Schedule shall be the addenda schedule listing the
acceptable sequence of work phases approved by DBI. Approval will be given upon
submission of a letter request from the applicant. The request letter for an
approved addenda schedule may be submitted after the issuance of site permit
and prior to, or jointly with, the submittal of the first addendum.
¬†¬†¬†j.¬†¬†¬†Approved Addendum is an addendum that has been submitted to the
Department for review, checked and approved. The addendum plans shall bear the
Department stamp of approval as described in SFBC Section
106A.4.1 and one set shall be kept at the work site as required by SFBC Section
106A.4.2. Work shall not proceed on the site until such time that approved
addendum plans indicating work permitted are on site and available. Each
approved addendum shall be considered as a permit.
¬†¬†¬†k.¬†¬†¬†Site Permit is a permit issued upon the approval of a building permit
application based on preliminary drawings and documentation. The Site Permit
plans shall describe the exterior of the building in sufficient detail and
dimensioned to mark heights, lengths, and widths. Court sizes, openings, and
other significant projections or recesses shall be located, sized, and
dimensioned. The interior shall indicate the Means of Egress systems, fire
separations that may be required for major building or area separations and for
occupancy separations greater than one hour. Property lines, both real and
assumed in cases of multi-buildings, shall be clearly delineated as well as
type of construction and other forms of basic information to establish the
design intent. Approval and issuance of a site permit alone does not allow for
construction. Additional construction documents submitted and approved as
addenda, complete the set of approved construction documents. (See Section 4
for Site Permit Submittal Package and Section 5 for Site Permit Review
Process).
¬†¬†¬†l.¬†¬†¬†Altered Site Permit is an alteration application to effectively retire
the Site Permit issued under the original permit application and activate an
alternate Site Permit as the sole survivor. A new approved addenda schedule
must be issued for the Altered Site Permit. Work described in addenda approved
under the original Site Permit may be carried forward onto the Altered Site
Permit addenda schedule. An Altered Site Permit will be required only in those
cases where a major change affects the concept of the original Site Permit. A
typical example may be to add or delete stories to the building.
2.¬†¬†¬†SITE PERMIT PROCESS
A Site Permit may be filed at Central Permit Bureau (CPB) for a new building
or, if the size of the project warrants, an alteration to an existing building.
Permit Processing Center (PPC) will be the central coordinating review agency
for all Site Permit applications and their attendant addenda.
3.¬†¬†¬†MARKINGS OF PLAN
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†All plans submitted for Site Permit shall be clearly marked by CPB
staff on the front of each plan sheet as follows:

above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access), the site permit
package shall include a preliminary smoke control report.
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Structural Design Criteria Document. For projects subject to Structural
Design Review per
AB-082, the site permit submittal package shall include the Structural Design
Criteria Documents as separately detailed by the Department of Building
Inspection.
¬†¬†¬†e.¬†¬†¬†Green Building Submittal. For projects subject to green building
regulations, see
AB-093.
NOTE: Acoustical Analysis Report will not be required at Site Permit Submittal.
The report will be required at Addenda Submittal if triggered by SFBC Section
1206.
Contact other Departments for additional materials required.
5.¬†¬†¬†SITE PERMIT REVIEW PROCESS
The Plan Checker shall review the site permit for major architectural/life
safety and accessibility issues. The following shall be included for Site
Permit review:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Building Information & Data: Describe the scope of work, use and
occupancy group classifications, construction type, number of stories and
basements, height, and sprinkler provisions. List all applicable codes
including the applicable version.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Allowable Height, Story and Area: Provide computations to document
analysis. Include sprinkler and area modification provisions where applicable.
¬†¬†¬†For mixed occupancies, state for the building or portions thereof, the
method of compliance, applying accessory occupancies, non-separated
occupancies, or separated occupancies where applicable. Tabulate the actual and
allowable height, story and area.
¬†¬†¬†For new buildings, tabulate the gross area for all basements and stories
individually and provide a summation of the total building area.
¬†¬†¬†For alterations with vertical and/or horizontal additions, tabulate the
gross area for the existing building and for the additional area (or reduced
area). Provide these values for all basements and stories individually. Provide
a summation of the total building area.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Exterior Wall and Opening Protection: Provide a plot plan locating the
building, adjoining properties and buildings, and public ways. Locate and
dimension property lines, both real and assumed in cases of two or more
buildings on the same lot regulated as separate buildings.
¬†¬†¬†Dimension the Fire Separation Distance (FSD) for all exterior walls and
openings adjacent to property lines. Tabulate the total area of unprotected and
protected openings per story. Tabulate the actual and allowable percentages
comparison for each opening type, per story. Indicate the rating for required
fire-resistive exterior walls.
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Means of Egress (MOE): Provide occupant loads and analysis of the MOE
system. Include diagonal dimensions of spaces requiring two or more exits and
the exit separation distances. Provide diagonal dimensions of each story or
portion thereof requiring two or more exits and the exit separation distances.
From the most remote point in a story or portion thereof to an exit, document
exit access travel distances. Where applicable, document the common path of
egress travel distance from the most remote point in a space, in a story or
portion thereof. Travel distances shall be measured rectilinearly at right
angles except where the direction of travel is guided by walls or other
permanent architectural features.
¬†¬†¬†e.¬†¬†¬†Fire-Resistance Elements and Ratings: Identify by legend or other
graphical methods, location of fire-resistance vertical and horizontal
assemblies required for the separation of occupancies, building portions, area
limits, shaft enclosures, exit enclosures, incidental accessory occupancies,
and other adjacent spaces. Include the fire-resistance rating for each of these
elements.
¬†¬†¬†f.¬†¬†¬†Emergency Escape and Rescue: Where applicable, provide compliant
exterior emergency escape and rescue openings. Such openings shall align with
the information documented on exterior building elevations approved by the
Planning Department. Changes affecting the exterior design subsequent to
Planning Department approval will necessitate rerouting the Site Permit to that
department for additional review.
¬†¬†¬†g.¬†¬†¬†Accessibility: Buildings and sites for covered residential occupancies,
public buildings, public accommodations, commercial buildings and publicly
funded housing shall be accessible to persons with disabilities. The Site
Permit shall provide sufficient details to document the accessible exterior
route of travel, general accessibility for entrances, exits and paths of
travel, accessible Means of Egress, and common use facilities, such as parking
and restrooms. (Review by the Mayor‚Äôs Office on Disability is not required at
site permit review stage, but is required prior to review of the architectural
addendum.)
¬†¬†¬†h.¬†¬†¬†Estimated Construction Valuation: Determine the estimated construction
cost.
¬†¬†¬†i.¬†¬†¬†SFUSD Fee: Determine the areas required for the calculation of SFUSD
fees.
Inasmuch as the purpose of a Site Permit is to allow review of preliminary
conceptual and schematic designs of proposed construction, there is no detailed
plan review of construction details required at the time of Site Permit review.
Such detailed review will be done at the time of addendum review.
The purpose of DBI‚Äôs plan review of Site Permits is to assure that there are no
major factors that would preclude the detailed design of a code-complying
structure.
The Plans Checker shall determine whether or not the Planning Department should
review any changes resulting from the rechecks. As a minimum, drawings showing
floor plans and elevations should have a Planning Department approval stamp.
6.¬†¬†¬†ADDENDA SUBMITTAL
The Applicant shall submit an addenda schedule prior to, or jointly with, the
submittal of the first addendum. This addenda schedule shall be retained in PPC
and distributed with the plans to the various review agencies/disciplines. All
addenda shall be submitted at CPB. The scope of work for each addendum shall be
clearly indicated on the cover sheet. Addenda can be submitted at any time
after issuance of the site permit. No addendum package can be submitted before
site permit is issued.
Addenda application form, 2 sets of plans for the addenda and 1 reference copy
of complete set of issued Site Permit plans shall be submitted.
7.¬†¬†¬†APPROVAL OF SEQUENCE OF PARTIAL CONSTRUCTION PHASES
The APPLICANT shall secure written approval from the Director of this proposed
division of work as the Approved Addenda Schedule defined in Item i of the
DEFINITIONS above. The request shall itemize and clearly define the extent
sought under each Addendum, such as:
¬†¬†¬†Addendum 1 - Grading
¬†¬†¬†Addendum 2 - Foundation
¬†¬†¬†Addendum 3 - Superstructure
¬†¬†¬†Addendum 4 - Final
The description of work for typical addenda is normally taken from the
DEFINITIONS. If, for particular reasons, an applicant wishes to vary the work
within addenda definitions, the exact work description shall be indicated in
the Addenda Schedule request and, if approved, shall likewise be shown in the
approved Addenda Schedule.
Acceptable phasing will be approved by the Director by confirmatory letter.
Such approval must be obtained before the first Addendum plans of a sequence
are filed. An addenda submitted to our Department shall have the contents of
the Approved Addenda Schedule for the particular Addendum noted on the first
plan sheet of the Addendum set.
The APPLICANT is cautioned to submit the Addendum plans sufficiently early to
permit processing and approval before any construction covered by such Addendum
is scheduled. It must be recognized that construction covered by successive
Addenda is generally overlapping and not sequential.
The applicant may file more than one addendum at a time, but un-issued active
addenda within the approval review process may not number more than three at
any time, unless otherwise approved.
8.¬†¬†¬†PROCESSING OF SITE PERMIT ADDENDA
DBI STAFF will verify at the time Site Permit Addenda are filed:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†that the Applicant has confirmatory letter from the Director approving
the proposed sequence of construction phases and that the notes on the front
sheet of the Addendum show the contents of work indicated on the Approval
Addenda Schedule;
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†unless otherwise approved, there are not more than three un-issued
addenda in the Department;
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†that the front of each sheet has been marked by Applicant as described
above;
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†that Addendum routing forms to accompany plans have been completely
filled out in duplicate.
DBI STAFF will mark outside of roll of plans with:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Application number;
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Date stamp;
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Description of phase of work covered by Addendum, by stamp if
appropriate.
If revisions to the Addendum plans are necessary, they will be submitted as
revised plans. Such revised plans will also be stamped with the phase of work
to be done unless those revisions are subsequent to an Approved Addendum, in
which case an alteration permit will be required.
All Site Permits Addenda will be routed directly to PPC. PPC will receive the
Addendum from the staff and will determine the further routing. The routing
will be accomplished by checking the appropriate boxes on the Addendum routing
form. The PLAN CHECKER will also verify, before approving same, that all plan
sheets and Addendum routing forms have been marked as described above.
The PLAN CHECKER shall verify that any required letters of permission by
adjoining owners for tie-back installation have been scanned on plans as part
of the GRADING Addendum documents.
The PLAN CHECKER will review the plans and approve them by signing the Addendum
routing form noting whatever conditions are required for approval, as would be
done for any permit application. When all required approvals have been
obtained, the plans and Addendum routing forms will be returned to the PPC
staff.
PPC STAFF will verify that all required approvals have been obtained, and will
then route to CPB. CPB will then notify the Applicant. In no event will any
Addendum be submitted until the original Site Permit has been issued. After the
Applicant has signed for the stipulations, he will receive one copy of the
approved plans and Addendum routing form to be kept on the job with his
original plans and Site Permit application. The CPB STAFF will forward the
office copy of the approved Addendum routing form and the Addendum to the
Records Management Division.

               January 19, 2011 (updated 01/01/2023 for code references)
DATE¬†¬†¬†:    (supersedes Administrative Bulletin AB-035 issued September 18,
               2002)
SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: General Administrative Procedures
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Procedure for Assigning Street Numbers (Addresses)
               To establish a procedure for assigning and/or changing street
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: numbers (addresses) to new buildings, tenant space street
               entrances, new parcels, vacant lots, and any other street
               addressing need of the City and County of San Francisco.
               Current edition of the San Francisco Building Code
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†107A.10, Building Numbers and Fees
               ¬†¬†¬†-
               Table 1A-J, Miscellaneous Fees
               Every project sponsor shall obtain an official street number
               prior to the submittal of a building permit application when the
               work consists of a new building or a new street entrance to a
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬new tenant space or dwelling unit in an existing building. Every
               residential property owner shall request in writing and receive
               approval from the Building Official for a change in a street
               number assignment. The following procedures shall apply to the
               assignment and/or change of street numbers.
¬†
Entrances to be Numbered
All primary entrances from the street to all buildings and all direct entrances
from the street to separate tenant spaces or dwelling units shall be numbered.
Only the building number officially assigned by the Building Official may be
displayed on the building.
The numbers shall be placed on the front of the building adjacent to the
entrance so as to be easily seen from the street. The street numbers assigned
shall be placed on the building in a place and manner acceptable to the
Building Official in accordance with Section
107A.10 of the San Francisco Building Code.
[Historical Note: The following procedures for assigning street numbers are
long term provisions of San Francisco codes. These procedures have been brought
forward from the 1909 San Francisco Building Code through subsequent editions
of that code.]
Method of Numbering
Market Street shall be the starting point for the numbers of all buildings
fronting on the streets beginning thereon and running therefrom in any
direction. On Webster, Fillmore, Steiner, Pierce, Scott, Divisadero, Broderick,
Baker and Lyon Streets, and Central Avenue, and streets in the Sunnyside,
Lakeview, Railroad Homestead and City Land Association tracts, the numbering
shall begin at their southerly ends and proceed toward the north.
On all streets having a northerly and southerly course, diverging less than 45
degrees from a northerly and southerly course and not otherwise provided for,
the numbering shall begin at their northerly ends and proceed toward the south.
On all streets having an easterly and westerly course, or diverging less than
45 degrees from an easterly and westerly course, the numbering shall begin at
their easterly ends and proceed toward the west, except that on streets lying
south of Cesar Chavez [Army Street] and running from Mission in an easterly or
southerly direction, and also on [Bernal Avenue], Montezuma and Aztec Streets,
Esmeralda Avenue, [and on streets in Gift Maps 1 and 2], the numbering shall
start at their westerly ends and proceed toward the east. On all intermediate
subdivision streets, the numbering shall commence where the streets begin and
proceed in the same direction as the numbering on the principal streets between
which they lie.
[Note: Street and place names which are shown in brackets no longer exist or
have been renamed.]
Even and Odd Numbers
On all streets the numbers on the right hand side, starting from the point of
beginning, shall be even numbers, and the numbers on the left hand side shall
be odd numbers; except that on all streets having a northerly and southerly
course, and lying west of Central Avenue and Presidio Avenue but not including
Central Avenue, the numbers on the right hand side, starting from the point of
beginning, shall be odd numbers and the numbers on the left hand side shall be
even numbers.
Allotment of Numbers
One hundred numbers, or as many thereof as may be necessary, shall be allotted
to the property frontage in each block between two main streets. The number 100
shall be the first number on the right hand side, and the number 101 the first
number on the left hand side of the second block of all streets, except those
lying west of Central Avenue and Presidio Avenue, but not including Central
Avenue. The succeeding hundreds shall be allotted in a similar manner
consecutively in each succeeding block, except that on Mission, Natoma, Howard,
Folsom, Harrison, Bryant, Jackson, Pacific, Broadway, Vallejo, Green, Union,
Francisco, Bay and Webster Streets, and on Central Avenue, 100 numbers shall be
allotted to the first two blocks. One hundred numbers shall also be allotted on
Divisadero Street between Waller and Page Streets. When a block exceeds 850
feet in length, 200 numbers shall be allotted to it.
For the purpose of preserving uniformity in the numbering along Market Street,
so that the numbers on both sides of the street shall conform as nearly as
possible, 50 even numbers shall be allotted to each of the following
apportionments of frontage along the northerly side of Market Street: between
the westerly line of Spear Street, proceeding northerly, and the easterly line
of Drumm Street; between Battery and Montgomery Streets; between Kearny and
Stockton Streets; between Powell and Taylor Streets; and between Jones Street
and [Marshall Square].
Fifty odd numbers shall be allotted to each of the following apportionments of
frontage along the southerly side of Market Street: between Embarcadero and
Spear Street; between Twelfth and Valencia Streets; between Guerrero and
Dolores Streets; and between Church and Sanchez Streets.
When any street fails in its course to traverse certain blocks, 100 numbers
shall be allotted to each block not traversed, in the same manner as if the
street were continuous. When any street is intersected on its opposite sides by
different streets, the hundreds on one side shall be made to correspond as
closely as possible to the hundreds on the opposite side by allotting only 25
numbers, even or odd as the case may require, to the side which the blocks are
shorter.
One number shall be allowed for each one-fiftieth (1/50) of the frontage of
each block between two main streets, except in blocks having a frontage of less
than 400 feet where the allowance shall be made on the basis of one number to
every eight feet of frontage.
Renumbering
Any Property Owner may request a change to an existing street number
assignment. Approval of the request for change to an existing street number
assignment shall not be denied if such request can reasonably be granted. A
request in writing must be made to the Building Official requesting a change to
the existing street number assignment. Proof of property ownership must be
submitted if requested by the Building Official and any other information as
needed for determination of request approval.
If a property is tenant-occupied, the property owner must also submit
documentation acceptable to the Building Official that all tenants have been
notified of the proposed street number change request.
Nothing in this bulletin shall authorize the renumbering of any block which is
now uniformly numbered in accordance with any previous law, unless such
renumbering is made necessary by the construction or alterations of buildings
whereby the number of entrances to buildings on such blocks has been so
increased as to prevent consecutive numbering.
Responsibilities
Building Official
The Building Official shall notify all applicable Federal, State, County, City
and local agencies requesting and/or requiring notification of new and/or
changed street number assignments. The Building Official shall also provide the
property owner with an approved and issued street number assignment permit.
Property Owner/Project Sponsor
The property owner/project sponsor must notify all private entities and tenants
of the issued street number assignment. The property owner must properly
identify the affected building(s) as provided in Section
107A.10 of the San Francisco Building Code within 60 days of the issued street
number assignment but no sooner than 10 days to allow for proper notification
to others.
Notice to be Given
Whenever any violation of the provisions of this bulletin relating to the
numbering of buildings exists, notice thereof shall be given to the owner, or
if they cannot be found, to the occupant of the premises where the violation
occurs. If, after two weeks, the cause of complaint has not been removed, the
provisions detailed in Section
103A of the San Francisco Building Code shall be applied.
Temporary Retention of Old Numbers
Whenever any property owner has been notified to change the numbers of his
building, the old numbers may be temporarily retained, in addition to the new
numbers, but in no case shall the old numbers be retained for more than sixty
(60) days after the official notice to change them.
Fees
The fee for each numbered building entrance is shown in Section
110A,
Table 1A-J of the San Francisco Building Code.

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Special Inspection for Demolition Work
               For demolition of buildings of Types I, II, III and IV
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: construction, and which are over 2 stories or 25 feet in height,
               a special inspector shall be on the site to observe and/or
               supervise the work to assure it is proceeding in a safe manner.

               Demolition work creates ongoing, and often sudden, life hazards.
               The general requirements for special inspection in San Francisco
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬Building Code Section
               1705.21, are made more specific in this ruling to reflect the
               need for extra supervision of such work.
¬†
Requirement
The Demolition Contractor or permit applicant shall identify the Special
Inspector for demolition work before a demolition permit is issued. For
buildings over 6 stories in height, the Contractor and Special Inspector shall
meet with the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) District Inspector to
review the demolition work and arrive at a clear understanding on what is
expected of all parties prior to the start of work. The Demolition Contractor
shall notify the Special Inspector and the District Inspector at least two days
prior to the start of the demolition operations. By obtaining the permit, the
applicant acknowledges the authority of the Special Inspector over the
demolition work as described below.
The Special Inspector:
1.¬†¬†¬†Shall be a registered Civil Engineer or licensed Architect, and
preferably, the individual who prepared the approved demolition sequence. The
Special Inspector shall be at the site at all times when dismantling or
demolition work is proceeding on any component which, when removed, reduces the
stability of the building. These include, but are not limited to, the
following:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†Exterior walls
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†Bearing walls
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†Beams, girders and columns
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†Diaphragms (roof and floors which contribute stability to building)
2.¬†¬†¬†Shall observe and/or direct that the work conforms with the sequence of
operations which was approved by DBI. In the event a potentially hazardous
situation develops as a result of conditions uncovered or unintentionally
created by the demolition work, the Special Inspector shall notify DBI by
telephone as soon as possible, and at that point shall require and allow only
corrective work to take place to substantially reduce the hazards present. The
Special Inspector shall then not allow any more work to be done until a revised
demolition sequence has been submitted to DBI and approved.
¬†¬†¬†In the event an unexpected development occurs which jeopardizes the public,
such as materials falling onto the street or partial collapse of a wall, the
Special Inspector may allow the demolition work to continue only if all the
following conditions are complied with:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†No continuing hazards to the public exist after the incident.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†No significant deviations from the approved sequence are necessary as a
result of the incident.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†The Contractor provides/establishes measures and assurances that such
incidents will not occur again, to the satisfaction of the Inspector.
¬†¬†¬†d.¬†¬†¬†The Special Inspector reports the incident to DBI in writing as soon as
possible. The report shall explicitly address the issues in conditions a
through c above.
¬†¬†¬†If the above conditions are not met, the Special Inspector shall stop the
job and notify DBI. The Special Inspector shall not allow the work to resume
until DBI gives permission.
¬†¬†¬†In the event deviations from the approved sequence are necessary due to
unexpected field conditions, and potentially hazardous conditions are not
present or would not be created, the inspector may allow or direct such
deviations be made without stopping the work. Such deviations shall be reported
in his next report to DBI.
3.¬†¬†¬†Shall make written reports to DBI on a weekly basis or as required by DBI.
Such reports shall include information on the progress of the demolition, any
deviations which were not reported previously, and a statement that the
demolition work is adhering to the approved sequence.
4.¬†¬†¬†May be an employee of the Special Inspector only when the following
conditions are complied with:
¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†The employee is a registered Civil Engineer or licensed Architect.
¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†The employee shall be under the immediate supervision of the Special
Inspector. The Special Inspector shall provide to DBI a written statement in
which he acknowledges complete responsibility for the inspection work, actions
and decisions of the employee.
¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†All reports shall be signed by the Engineer or Architect.

               Vocational Regulations
               These guidelines shall be used in instances where a licensed
               design professional or contractor appears to be in substantial
               noncompliance with the regulations governing their activities.
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬Such substantial noncompliance may include activities which
               appear to be, but not be limited to, unlicensed practice, gross
               incompetence, negligence, violation of local codes and
               regulations, or the provision of false or misleading
               information.
¬†
The Department of Building Inspection shall review concerns based on
information available and make recommendations as are believed to be consistent
with public safety and welfare. The Department shall not hold hearings, take
testimony, engage in debate with the regulated or licensed persons, or
otherwise assume the role of another regulatory agency.

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Board of Examiners: Request for Variance, New Materials, or
               Alternate Methods of Construction
               To establish policies and procedures for hearings before the
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: Board of Examiners to request a variance from a building code
               requirement, or approval for the use of new or alternate
               materials, methods or types of construction.

               110A, Table 1A-K Penalties, Hearings, Code Enforcement
               Assessments
               An applicant for a building permit may find that a specific new
               construction material, method of construction or type of
               construction cannot be approved by the Department of Building
               Inspection (DBI) because it does not comply with the specific
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬requirements of the code. An applicant may find that it is
               difficult to achieve full compliance with the requirements of
               the building codes without experiencing practical difficulties.
               Under those circumstances the applicant may appeal to the Board
               of Examiners for approval of a variance or a new or alternate
               material, method or type of construction.
¬†
The Board of Examiners, after reviewing submitted exhibits and data with
respect to a building permit application, is empowered to determine whether the
use of new or unusual products or construction methods complies with the
standards of safety set by the various codes. Likewise, the Board of Examiners
may determine whether variances from the requirements of the codes can be
accepted in instances where compliance would result in a practical difficulty
or unreasonable hardship. A determination of acceptance may include conditions
which must be satisfied. The Board of Examiners may not approve a request which
would result in a condition less safe than otherwise required by the codes.
Review and Appeals with DBI Staff
Before an appeal of a matter may be made to the Board of Examiners, the permit
applicant must request review of a staff disapproval of a proposed condition of
a building permit application to the next level of DBI management, up to and
including the Director (see Attachment A Diagram AB-042.) The San Francisco
Fire Department must be consulted when a matter is within their jurisdiction.
Any Fire Department disapproval may be appealed in accordance with Fire
Department procedures. DBI and Fire Department review at each step shall be
completed within 10 working days of the request by the appellant or the request
shall be deemed disapproved and may advance to the next administrative review
level.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Where permit applicants do not agree with staff regarding an interpretation
of the codes, or where applicants are denied approval to use a new material,
method or type of construction, the disagreement or denial may be appealed to
the plan reviewer‚Äôs Team Leader or to the Senior Inspector supervising the
field inspector.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†If unable to reach an agreement with the Team Leader or Senior Inspector,
the permit applicant may appeal the disagreement or denial to the Division
Supervisor, Chief or Manager for resolution.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†If unable to reach an agreement with the Division‚Äôs Supervisor, Chief or
Manager, the issue may be taken up with the Deputy Director of Permit Services
or the Deputy Director of Inspection Services for resolution.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The Deputy Director may choose to meet with the Director of the Department
of Building Inspection before issuing a final administrative determination. If
the permit applicant does not accept the Director‚Äôs conclusion, the applicant
may then appeal to the Board of Examiners if the issue is within that Board‚Äôs
jurisdiction.
Request for Board of Examiners Review
Requests for Board of Examiners review must be submitted in writing (see
Attachment B Form AB-042.)
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Submit 10 completed copies of Form AB-042 along with all other relevant
information such as architectural plans, engineering reports, laboratory test
data, and photos to:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Secretary, Board of Examiners
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Department of Building Inspection
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†49 South Van Ness Ave., 5th Floor
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†San Francisco, CA 94103
¬†¬†¬†The Board of Examiners will not review requests which do not, in the opinion
of the Secretary of the Board of Examiners, include all necessary data, test
results, and related materials.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Enclose a check for the filing fee made payable to the Department of
Building Inspection in the amount listed in Table 1A-K of the San Francisco
Building Code.
Meeting Date and Application Deadline
The Board of Examiners meets to consider appeals as scheduled by the Secretary
of the Board of Examiners. Requests for appeals to the Board of Examiners
should allow at least three weeks before a hearing will be held.

DBI will send the appellant an agenda and a notification of a scheduled hearing
at least ten days before the meeting. DBI will post the agenda at the location
of the meeting and at the main branch of the San Francisco Public Library at
least 72 hours before the hearing. All meetings are open to the public.
Unless otherwise noticed, the public meetings are held in the evenings at:
¬†¬†¬†Department of Building Inspection
¬†¬†¬†49 South Van Ness Ave.
¬†¬†¬†San Francisco, CA 94103
Hearing Procedures
Prior to the hearing, the Director of the Department of Building Inspection and
the Fire Marshal will review the materials submitted by the appellant and will
separately submit recommendations for disposition of the appeal to the Board of
Examiners.
At the hearing, representatives of the Department of Building Inspection and
the Fire Department will introduce the case to the Board of Examiners and
present their recommendations. The appellant may then present their argument.
The appellant may include the testimony of recognized experts to substantiate
their petition.
The Board of Examiners will render a decision at the public hearing, or may
continue the case to the next meeting pending submittal of additional data or
clarification. When the Board of Examiners arrives at a conclusion, a
resolution called a ‚ÄúNotice of Decision‚Äù detailing the decision and
recommendation will be prepared by the Secretary of the Board of Examiners,
filed with the Director of the Department of Building Inspection. A copy of the
‚ÄúNotice of Decision‚Äù will be mailed to the appellant. The Secretary of the
Board of Examiners will prepare official meeting minutes for approval at the
next meeting. It is recommended that the applicant attach a copy of the ‚ÄúNotice
of Decision‚Äù to any related permit application.
The Notice of Decision shall be microfilmed as part of the official records for
the property.
Rehearing
A rehearing may be requested by any party when there is substantial new
evidence which could not have been submitted at the time of the original
hearing. Upon approval of a request for rehearing by the Board of Examiner, a
date of a rehearing will be set.
Appeals
Where appellants do not agree with the decision of the Board of Examiners
regarding a variance from requirements of the codes or where the appellants are
denied the use of a new material, method or type of construction, the appellant
may appeal the Board of Examiner‚Äôs decision to the Building Inspection
Commission.

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Ventilation of Public Spaces in Group R Occupancies
               To provide guidelines for determining which public spaces may require
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: ventilation, and to describe acceptable examples of providing ventilation to
               these spaces.

               Current edition of the San Francisco
               Mechanical Code Sections 402.0 and 403.0 .
               The San Francisco
               Housing Code (SFHC) and the San Francisco Building Code (SFBC) requires a
               minimum level of ventilation in the public circulation spaces of Group R
               Occupancies. San Francisco‚Äôs deep and narrow lots coupled with a tradition of
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬property line-to-property line construction often results in multifamily
               residential buildings with long hallways that have limited access to exterior
               openings. With little or no ventilation available to these hallways and other
               public spaces such as stairways and lobbies, the air can become stagnant and
               may retain cooking or tobacco odors.
¬†
The intent of the California Building Code (CBC) Section 1202.5 is to assure
adequate ventilation of Group R Occupancies. The intent of the San Francisco
amendment to Section 1202.5 is to assure adequate ventilation of all public
circulation spaces, particularly those which have directly-communicating
openings into adjoining dwelling units or habitable spaces. This includes
enclosed stairways and vestibules which also have entry doors to dwelling units
or other habitable spaces. Pressurized stair enclosures need not be ventilated.
The following are acceptable means of providing ventilation:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Operable windows with an openable area of not less than 1/25 of the
floor area of the area ventilated with a minimum of 4 square feet (0.37 m2).
The windows shall open directly onto a public way or a yard or a court when
permitted by Table 705.8. See SFBC Section 1205 for minimum sizes of yards and
courts adjacent to exterior openings that provide natural ventilation.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Skylights with an openable area of not less than 1/25 of the floor area
of the area ventilated with a minimum of 4 square feet (0.37 m2). The skylight
shall be fixed open or shall be provided with an approved opening device.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Operable or fixed louvers with a net effective area of not less than 1/
25 of the floor area of the area ventilated with a minimum of 4 square feet
(0.37 m2). The operable louver shall be provided with an approved operating
device.
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Exterior openings set with screens, bars or grilles providing a net
free (effective) area of not less than 1/25 of the floor area of the area
ventilated with a minimum of 4 square feet (0.37 m2).
¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†Wind-operated turbines may be used in lieu of natural ventilation to
provide a minimum of 2 complete air changes per hour throughout the public
circulation space with a minimum of 15 cubic feet per minute (7L/s) of outside
air per occupant during such time as the building is occupied. Provide a make-
up air inlet at a location that will not result in a short-circuiting of air
flow, or where it will pick up objectionable odors, fumes or flammable vapors.
For calculating ventilation, the minimum average wind speed shall be 7.5 miles
per hour. [Based upon information from the National Climate Data Center, the
lowest average wind speed in San Francisco is 6.7 mph in May.]
¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†Mechanical ventilation and exhaust designed to operate continuously and
capable of providing not less than that required by San Francisco Mechanical
Code Section 403.0 throughout the public circulation space during such time as
the building is occupied. Provide a make-up air inlet at a location that will
not result in a short-circuiting of air flow, or where it will pick up
objectionable odors, fumes or flammable vapors.
When natural or mechanical ventilation methods as described above are not
feasible, the applicant may present an alternate means of providing ventilation
for consideration by the building official.
When required by SFBC Sections 713 and 716, provide smoke and/or fire dampers
at penetrations of fire-rated assemblies. Comply with the requirements of San
Francisco Mechanical Code when locating ventilation openings near exhaust
outlets, vent or chimney terminations.
Refer to the San Francisco Housing Code for maintenance of natural and
mechanical ventilation systems in existing (prior to January 1, 2011) Group R,
Division 1 & 2 Occupancies.

I.¬†¬†¬†DEFINITIONS
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Special Inspection
¬†¬†¬†Special Inspection is the monitoring of the materials and workmanship that
are critical to the integrity of building structures or are otherwise required
for public safety. Special inspection is intended to assure that the approved
plans and specifications are being followed and that relevant codes and
ordinances are being observed. The special inspection process is in addition to
the regular inspections conducted by Department of Building Inspection building
inspectors and by the engineer or architect of record. The special inspectors
furnish continuous or periodic inspection as required by the San Francisco
Building Code (SFBC).
¬†¬†¬†Good communication between the special inspector and the designers,
contractor, and building department is essential to project quality assurance.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Structural Observation
¬†¬†¬†Structural observation is visual observation of the structural system, for
general conformance with the approved plans and specifications, at significant
construction stages and at completion of the structural system, as required by
SFBC Section
1704.6. Structural observation does not include or waive the responsibility for
the inspections required by Section
108A,
1704,
1705, or other sections of this code. [SFBC Sec. 202]

and exhaust, symmetrical smooth construction) the critical air velocity
calculation required to prevent the backflow of smoke may be per NFPA 92,
section 5.10, Opposed Airflow and CBC, Section 909.7.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†In spaces with complicated geometry (rough, asymmetric
construction) and/or where/when tenability is used as design criteria, CFD
analysis is required. A complicated geometry is where airflow is obstructed,
multiple air supplies, or construction is asymmetrical.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†All openings in smoke control zones that are operable shall be

SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Disabled Access
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Disabled Access Compliance Status Documentation
               The purpose of this Bulletin is to establish a procedure under
               which permit applicants can achieve and document full or partial
               building accessibility. It is the intent of the Department of
               Building Inspection to document buildings or portions of
               buildings that are in compliance with current accessibility
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: requirements, thus reducing the need for permit applicants to
               submit reference drawings and other duplicative documents in
               areas deemed in compliance.
               Such documentation of accessibility is to be reviewed and
               updated upon adoption of each new edition of the California
               Building Code or relevant amendment to that code.
               Current edition of the San Francisco Building Code
               -
               Chapter 11B, Accessibility to Public Buildings, Public
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†Accommodations, Commercial Buildings and Publicly Funded Housing
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section
               106A.3.3, Information on plans and specifications
               ¬†¬†¬†- Section
               106A.4.3, Validity of permit
               Project sponsors must meet certain disability access
               requirements as part of the permit, construction and building
               alteration process. The submittal of documentation to
               demonstrate disabled access compliance for each area of
               construction work or other building alteration has posed a
               burden on permit applicants and the Department of Building
               Inspection. To help reduce this burden while maintaining code
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬compliance, the Department will accept a separate permit
               application documenting the status of disabled access compliance
               under current building codes. This will obviate the need for
               repeated submittal and review of multiple sets of identical
               documents for a single building. Such separate permit for
               disabled access compliance may then be referenced on subsequent
               permit applications, assuring required disabled access
               compliance under each such permit.
¬†
In order to demonstrate compliance with disabled access requirements, project
sponsors must submit documentation accompanying permit applications. Such
documentation may include drawings or, where a building or a portion of a
building has been determined under previous permit to be in compliance with
disabled access requirements, may include a Letter of Disabled Access
Compliance Status referencing completed permits and related drawings on file
with the Building Department.
PROCEDURES
The following procedures apply for the submittal and approval of permits which
result in the issuance of a Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status.
If a building owner wishes to document full or partial access compliance, a
permit application may be submitted indicating, as the description of work,
Disabled Access Compliance Status. Such permit application for Disabled Access
Compliance Status should include a permit cost valuation of $1.00. All review
of submittal documents done by the Department of Building Inspection prior to
permit issuance will be billed on an hourly basis in accordance with San
Francisco Building Code (SFBC)
Table 1A-B, Item 2, Back Check Fee. Any construction work that is determined to
be necessary under this permit application shall be properly valued and
appropriate permit fees shall be charged for such valuation.
The Disabled Access Compliance Status permit application may be submitted
concurrently with or prior to the submittal of other permit applications for
construction or tenant improvement work. All permits shall be linked by clear
statements on the permit applications for both the disabled access compliance
work and any other construction work. The statement on the permit application
for the disabled access compliance work should read, ‚ÄúTo comply with Disabled
Access required under Permit Application #_______________.‚Äù The statement on
the permit applications for the tenant improvement work or other construction
work should, similarly, note ‚ÄúDisabled Access work related to this construction
is being done under Permit Application #_____________.‚Äù Disability access
within areas of tenant improvement shall be shown on the tenant improvement
plans.
Permits may be routed separately for plan review and may be approved
separately.
Plan Review Procedures
¬†¬†¬†a)¬†¬†¬†All permits must be accompanied by three sets of submittal documents
that indicate required compliance with those portions of the building that the
project sponsor wishes to certify. Such portions may include parking, entry,
path of travel, public areas such as lobbies, elevators, rest rooms, and other
disabled access features. Individual tenant spaces are not included as part of
this compliance status documentation. Submittal documents shall include a ‚Äúkey‚Äù
map or other clear diagram of the areas to be reviewed for compliance. All
submittal documents must be signed by a licensed architect or engineer.
¬†¬†¬†b)¬†¬†¬†Other permits for tenant improvement work during the period when the
Disabled Access Compliance Status Documentation permit application is under
review must reference the Permit Application number for the Disabled Access
Compliance Status Documentation permit.
¬†¬†¬†c)¬†¬†¬†A permit issued for Disabled Access Compliance Status Documentation may
be referenced by subsequent permits to demonstrate that disabled access
compliance is being addressed or that such work has been completed and deemed
satisfactory in meeting code requirements.
Field Inspection Procedures
Field inspection of disabled access features shall be done by an inspector with
special expertise in this field as designated by the Director or otherwise in
accordance with policies and regulations developed by the Department.
Permit Time Limits
¬†¬†¬†a)¬†¬†¬†Plan review time limits shall be as detailed in SFBC Section
106A.3.7, Application Expiration.
¬†¬†¬†b)¬†¬†¬†Following issuance of a permit for Disabled Access Compliance Status,
if work is to be done, such work must be started and completed within the times
allowed, based on the permit valuation. See SFBC Section
106A.4.4, Permit Expiration.
¬†¬†¬†c)¬†¬†¬†Permit extensions shall apply per SFBC Section
106A.4.4, Permit Expiration.
Permit Sign-Off
¬†¬†¬†a)¬†¬†¬†Temporary occupancy may be allowed in accordance with the policies of
the Department of Building Inspection.
¬†¬†¬†b)¬†¬†¬†A final sign-off on the permit for Disabled Access Compliance Status
Documentation will be made by the District Building Inspector or by other staff
assigned by the Director following completion of all work.
Issuance of Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status
Upon completion and final sign-off of any Permit Application for Disabled
Access Compliance Status Documentation, the Department will issue a Letter of
Disabled Access Compliance Status indicating the scope of approved disabled
access compliance and any special conditions or exceptions that may apply,
including such items as Unreasonable Hardships or Access Appeal Commission
decisions. The Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status must be copied onto
any plans that are submitted for subsequent work on the building which intend
to refer to this compliance permit. The Department has the authority to revoke
any such letter at any time for any reason if disabled access is not being
provided in full accord with the requirements of the law or in compliance with
the conditions of the letter.
A copy of the Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status and the related
approved permit documents shall be maintained by the Department of Building
Inspection in an accessible, paper form to allow easy reference by staff and
other interested parties. Such documents shall also be microfilmed or otherwise
recorded as part of the permanent records of the property.
Revisions/Reissuance of an Issued Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status
The Department will require that any issued Letter of Disabled Access
Compliance Status conform to changes to disabled access regulations as they
occur. This will require a review and update of each Letter of Disabled Access
Compliance Status upon adoption of each new edition of the California Building
Code or relevant amendment to that code. Compliance with such new code
requirements will only be required if:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Such code requirements apply retroactively
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Subsequent construction work or other building alteration triggers such
additional disabled access requirements
A project sponsor may apply for a permit to alter the scope of the Disabled
Access Letter of Compliance. An additional permit and plans will be required to
verify conformance with code requirements for disabled access when a Letter of
Disabled Access Compliance Status is revised or reissued.
When Access Appeals Commission decisions relate to portions of the building
covered by this Letter of Disabled Access Compliance Status, such appeals
decisions will be referenced in the letter and all Access Appeals Commission
conditions must be met as a condition of the letter. When the Access Appeals
Commission has defined a time period as part of an appeal decision, such time
period will be noted by date of expiration on the Letter of Disabled Access
Compliance Status. Issues related to that AAC decision must be reconsidered
following the expiration of such time period.

               The installation of roof penthouses throughout the City is an
               issue of serious concern to the public and the Planning
               Department inasmuch as such penthouses may expand structures to
               larger than may be compatible with surrounding structures and
               may block sunlight and views. Roof penthouses are often a basis
               of extensive Planning and Building Department review, permit
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬appeals and reconsideration during construction. The use of roof
               hatches in lieu of stair penthouses under certain conditions can
               do much to resolve the problems related to roof penthouses,
               could permit rapid processing and issuance, and, if installed in
               accordance with the following conditions, would not impair the
               code-mandated suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire
               resistance, durability, safety or sanitation of the standard
               method of roof access.
¬†
This bulletin does not apply to buildings under the jurisdiction of the San
Francisco Fire Department, although requests to apply alternates and
equivalencies to the regular code will be considered by the Fire Department on
a case-by-case basis.
The use of roof hatches under this Administrative Bulletin is limited to the
following applications:
1.¬†¬†¬†Where proposed roof hatches provide access to the roof of buildings under
the jurisdiction of the Department of Building Inspection, and
2.¬†¬†¬†Where a stairway to the roof is either required by code or voluntarily
proposed, and
3.¬†¬†¬†Where the roof hatch and its appurtenances are approved and constructed as
detailed below, and
4.¬†¬†¬†When the roof hatch is served by a stairway.
Other applications for roof hatches in lieu of required fully complying
stairways will be considered on a case-by-case basis under the review and
approval procedures in the California Building Code regarding ‚ÄúModifications‚Äù
and ‚ÄúAlternative materials, alternate designs and methods of construction.‚Äù
Note: Under Section
1011.12, Exception: In buildings without an occupied roof, access to the roof
shall be permitted to be a roof hatch or trap door not less than16 square feet
in area and having a minimum dimension of 2 feet.
Procedure for Application of Local Equivalency
Project sponsors wishing to apply Local Equivalencies must fill out and submit
the request for Approval of Local Equivalencies on a standard form (Attachment
A). Fees to be paid and scheduling of review of requests are as noted on that
form. Following Department of Building Inspection and, as appropriate, other
agency review, each request will be approved, approved with conditions,
disapproved, or placed on ‚ÄúHold‚Äù pending submittal of additional information.
Further details of procedures for the review of Local Equivalencies and appeal
of departmental determinations may be found in
AB-005, Procedures for Approval of Local Equivalencies.
Conditions of Local Equivalency
Roof hatches in lieu of stairway penthouses may be permitted when the following
approved equivalent provisions are met. This Local Equivalency allows roof
hatches to be used in lieu of stairway penthouses and for such roof hatch to be
considered as meeting the code requirements for a stairway to the roof if the
below listed standard provisions are met:
1.¬†¬†¬†Applicant shall submit drawings showing details of the proposed roof
hatch, stairway, stair handrail, and other details as needed to demonstrate
compliance, insofar as is practical, with the stairway requirements of the San
Francisco Building Code. Submittal documents shall include a plan view showing
the location of the roof hatch and stairway and shall include sections and/or
elevations detailing the proposed installation.
2.¬†¬†¬†Stairways shall have handrails on at least one side. At least one handrail
shall extend at least 34 inches above the roof surface. Such handrail may be
attached to the underside of the operable hatch so that it is in the correct
position for handrails when the hatch is in the open position, or it may be
secured to the roof or other construction. Minor breaks in the continuity of
the handrail are permitted; handrail sections must be generally aligned.
3.¬†¬†¬†If the opening for the stairway to the roof is within the distance where
protection of openings is required, then parapets extending along the parapet
wall at least the length of the opening shall be provided per Section 705.11.
4.¬†¬†¬†The curb at the roof opening for the roof hatch on the side where the
stairs emerge from the interior shall extend above the roof surface no more
than nine inches, the curb at the roof hatch on other sides of the hatch shall
not exceed 24 inches above the roof surface, and the maximum height of any
portion of the hatch in a closed position shall not exceed 36 inches above the
roof surface.
5.¬†¬†¬†The rise and run of stairs to the roof shall meet regular code
requirements.
6.¬†¬†¬†The width of a stairway to a roof and the clear width of a roof hatch in
its open position shall be not less than 30 inches, except that when serving an
occupied roof with an occupant load of 10 or more or serving an occupied roof
area greater than 400 square feet the width shall meet the specific
requirements of the San Francisco Building Code. Handrails, lifting mechanisms
and other equipment may encroach into the required width up to 1 1/2" when the
roof hatch is in a fully open position.
7.¬†¬†¬†When the roof hatch serves an occupied roof, the hatch latching mechanism
shall be operable from the exterior.
A permit application and related submittal documents shall detail all
construction that is approved as a result of this Request for Approval of Local
Equivalency. No work to install roof hatches in lieu of stairway penthouses
shall be done prior to approval of such Permit Application and issuance of a
permit.

               Information regarding building performance in earthquakes is
               important in improving construction practices to further reduce
               the risk of future earthquake damage by developing codes,
               standards, and mitigation measures. Such information also helps
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬to understand the movement of buildings following earthquakes
               and provides data to guide in the inspection, testing and repair
               of post-earthquake building damage. San Francisco has adopted
               California Building Code Appendix L, requiring provision of
               instrumentation for the collection of building seismic data.
¬†
A.¬†¬†¬†REQUIRED INSTRUMENTATION
Installation Required
As detailed in California Building Code Appendix L, every new building in San
Francisco over six stories in height with an aggregate floor area of 60,000
square feet (5574 m2) or more, and every new building over 10 stories in height
regardless of floor area, shall be provided with not less than three approved
recording accelerographs with triaxial seismic sensors.
Approval and Documentation of Instrumentation
Project sponsors who are required to provide accelerographs for new buildings
must submit two sets of submittal documents, as part of the building permit
submittal documents, detailing the proposed installation. Such documents shall
clearly identify the following:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Floor plans of building showing locations of accelerographs.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Specifications of accelerographs and related instruments and equipment.
Plans will be submitted to DBI for approval.
Approved plans will be transmitted to California Strong Motion Instrumentation
Program.
Guidelines for Installation of Accelerographs:
1.¬†¬†¬†Location. The accelerographs shall be located in the basement, midportion,
and near the top of the building. The preferred locations for the
accelerographs are in small, seldom-used rooms or closets near a column.
Instruments ideally should be vertically aligned. Adequate space shall be
provided to mount the accelerographs and to contain an approved protective
enclosure. The protective enclosure shall be securely fastened to the floor or
ceiling.
2.¬†¬†¬†Service Requirements. Each accelerograph shall be located so that access
is maintained at all times. Access shall be unobstructed by room contents. A
sign stating ‚ÄúMaintain Clear Access To This Instrument‚Äù shall be posted in a
conspicuous location near each instrument. This sign shall also include the
phone numbers of the local building contact and the Department of Building
Inspection.
Each accelerograph requires AC power.
A dial-up telephone line is required at the base-level accelerograph.
3.¬†¬†¬†Installation Details. All accelerographs shall be installed with the same
orientation relative to the building, with the orientation chosen such that the
reference or long dimension of the instrument is aligned with a major axis of
the building. The orientation shall be clearly and permanently marked on the
floor near the location of each instrument. The accelerographs‚Äô triggering
threshold shall be set to 1% g, nominal. Auxiliary devices (e.g. telephone
switch) shall be secured to the floor, ceiling or the enclosure.
4.¬†¬†¬†The accelerographs shall be interconnected for common start and common
timing.
5.¬†¬†¬†The owner of the building shall be responsible for the correct
installation and the required documentation of the accelerographs.
Maintenance
1.¬†¬†¬†Programs for the maintenance and service of the instruments, and remote
and onsite access to the data, shall be provided by the owner of the building,
subject to approval by the Director of DBI. Once each year, the building owner
shall submit a form to DBI certifying that the equipment is in operating order
and describing any changes in the equipment or access procedures. (See attached
Appendix B ‚Äì Instrumentation Program and Annual Renewal).
2.¬†¬†¬†Log book on-site by owner.
3.¬†¬†¬†Long Term Monitoring and Data Recovery. Upon acceptance of the
installation, the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program agrees to
perform long-term monitoring of the accelerographs to help assure their correct
operation. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program will perform
periodic operational checks and function tests remotely via the provided phone
line. California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program will notify the building
contact person and Department of Building Inspection when any repair actions
are needed. For instruments monitored by CSMIP, equipment operation will be
remotely checked and the building owner will be notified of needed repairs.
Needed repairs shall be made by the building owner.
Data Recovery and Analysis
Data produced by the instruments shall be made available to DBI upon request.
Data shall be retrievable remotely by internet connection or modem. After a
significant earthquake, California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program will
recover the recorded data, process it and provide results to the designated
building contact person and to the Department of Building Inspection. With the
approval of the Department of Building Inspection, strong motion data from an
instrumented building may be made public on the California Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program web site, with the location of the building identified
generically, with no specific building address provided.
If the basement acceleration exceeds 5% g then the set of records must be
transmitted to the owner and DBI.
B.¬†¬†¬†VOLUNTARY INSTRUMENTATION
Voluntary instrumentation of new and existing buildings not required to be
instrumented is encouraged. Compliance to the guidelines in this Administrative
Bulletin is recommended for voluntary instrumentation.
If inspections are required, data from instrumentation systems meeting the
minimum standards of California Building code Appendix Lwill be considered for
reduction of connection inspection requirements following an earthquake. More
comprehensive instrumentation is strongly recommended, particularly for tall or
irregular buildings.

1.¬†¬†¬†SCOPE OF THIS BULLETIN
This bulletin addresses Structural, Geotechnical, and Seismic Hazard
Engineering Design Review of buildings and other structures (referred to herein
as ‚ÄúReview‚Äù). Review may apply to design of new structures, or addition,
alteration, or retrofit of existing structures. It may apply to projects
designed to the prescriptive provisions of the SFBC or to projects
incorporating exceptions to the prescriptive provisions of the SFBC, at the
discretion of the Director of the Department of Building Inspection (SFDBI).
Review may include one or more of the following disciplines:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Structural Engineering
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Geotechnical Engineering
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Earthquake Ground Motion Selection and Scaling
¬†
Commentary: The term ‚ÄúStructural, Geotechnical, and Seismic Hazard Engineering Design
Review‚Äù (or ‚ÄúReview‚Äù) used herein is often referred to as ‚ÄúPeer Review.‚Äù It encompasses
‚ÄúDesign Review‚Äù as required by ASCE 7-16 Section 16.5 (Seismic Response History
Procedures), 17.7 (Seismically Isolated Structures), and 18.5 (Structures with Damping
Systems). The Director requires Review when implicated by these Building Code sections,
and may require Review in other instances as deemed necessary by the Director.
Reviewers and Review teams are distinct from a Structural Advisory Committee, which is a
public body that the Director may convene in accordance with SFBC Section
105A.6 ‚Äúto advise the Building Official on matters pertaining to the design and
construction of buildings with special features or special design procedures.‚Äù
2.¬†¬†¬†PURPOSE OF REVIEW
If the Director determines that Review is required, the Director shall request
one or more Structural, Geotechnical, or Seismic Hazard Reviewers having
specialized knowledge and experience to provide their professional opinion on
identified aspects of a project. The purpose of the Review is to provide an
independent, objective, technical review of those aspects of the project design
that are identified in the scope of the Review. For projects that are intended
to be fully compliant with the prescriptive provisions of the SFBC, the purpose
of the Review also includes advising the Director whether the design aspects in
the scope of the Review satisfy the prescriptive requirements of the SFBC. For
projects incorporating exceptions to the prescriptive provisions of the SFBC,
the purpose of the Review also includes advising the Director whether the
design aspects in the scope of the Review satisfy the requirements of SFBC
Section
104A.2.8 (‚ÄúAlternative materials, design, and methods of construction‚Äù) or
other requirements or criteria identified in the scope of the review.
The Review shall not be construed to replace quality assurance measures
ordinarily exercised by the Structural or Geotechnical Engineer of Record in
the design of a structure or development of geotechnical design
recommendations. Responsibility for the design, and the responsibility to
demonstrate conformance of the design to the SFBC, resides solely with the
Engineer of Record. The responsibility for conducting plan check resides with
the Director and any plan check consultants. The responsibility for acceptance
of a design and any decisions on the issuance of permits resides solely with
the Director.
3.¬†¬†¬†ADMINISTRATION OF REVIEW
Reviewers contract with SFDBI and are responsible to the Director. SFDBI is
responsible for the payment of fees and other expenses for the professional
services of the Reviewer(s). Reviewers shall provide their professional opinion
to the Director and shall sign all written communication to the Director.
¬†
Commentary: SFDBI‚Äôs new process retains the Reviewer‚Äôs responsibility to the
Director and aligns with a number of jurisdictions that contract directly with
Reviewers and pass the cost through to the Project Sponsor. Previously, the City
of San Francisco procedures for procurement of professional services have not
been suited to directly contracting with consulting engineers, and Reviewers
instead contracted with the Project Sponsor. The Reviewers nevertheless are
responsible to and act under the instructions of the Director.
The Structural Engineers Association Recommended Guidelines for the Practice of
Structural Engineering in California, 5th Edition (1999) recommends that
appropriate language regarding design responsibility be included in the
Reviewer‚Äôs contract:
‚ÄúResponsibility for the structural design remains with the [Engineer of Record]
because the [Reviewer] has no contractual ability to change or prepare contract
documents. For this reason, an appropriate indemnification clause should be
included in the [Reviewer‚Äôs] agreement with the client.‚Äù
Responsibilities of the Chair of a Review Team
On a project for which there is more than one Reviewer, the Director shall
designate one of the Reviewers to serve as Chair of the Review Team. The Chair
is responsible for leading the Review in his or her own discipline and for
coordinating the Review. The Chair does not take responsibility for the
professional opinions of Reviewers of other disciplines. Either the Reviewers
jointly write a letter or letters expressing the opinions of the Review Team,
or the Reviewers in each discipline write separate letters to the Director
addressing the findings and review scope for their discipline. Reviewers
provide their professional opinion only in their area of expertise.
Distinction between Review reports and Construction Documents
None of the reports or documents from the Reviewer(s) are Construction
Documents. Under no circumstances should letters or other documents from the
Reviewer(s) be put into the Engineer of Record‚Äôs project drawings or reproduced
in any other way that makes Reviewer documents appear to be part of the
Construction Contract Documents. The Engineer of Record is solely responsible
for the Construction Contract Documents. Documents from the Reviewer(s) will be
retained as part of SFDBI‚Äôs project files.
4.¬†¬†¬†QUALIFICATIONS AND SELECTION OF REVIEWERS
Each Reviewer shall be selected by the Director based on the Reviewer‚Äôs
qualifications applicable to the project and considering availability relative
to the project schedule. The Director may, at his or her discretion, consult
with the Project Sponsor, the Engineer of Record, or others before selecting
the Reviewer(s), with the final selection of the Reviewer(s) being the sole
responsibility of the Director. Reviewers shall disclose to the Director, in
writing, any potential conflict of interest related to the project, the desired
scope of Review, or the ability of the Reviewer to be independent and objective
in the Review.
Each Reviewer providing professional engineering services shall be a Registered
Design Professional holding a Professional Engineer (P.E.) license, in
accordance with California law. Qualified engineering staff and reviewers not
registered as a P.E., including reviewers from academia, can contribute to the
review under the responsible charge of a registered P.E.
Additional registration requirements for each Review discipline are specified
below. Where suitably qualified, it is acceptable for one Reviewer to fulfill
more than one of these roles.
Structural Engineering Design Reviewers
Structural Engineering Design Reviewers shall have experience in structural
engineering pertinent to the review scope and type of structure. If applicable
to the review scope, they shall have experience in:

materials, design and methods‚Äù provisions of the SFBC
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Performance-based engineering
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Structural design and detailing for seismic performance
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Seismic evaluation and retrofit of existing structures
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Design of structures incorporating the materials, systems, and
technologies to be incorporated in the project
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Nonlinear response-history analysis
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Applicable structural engineering research
In addition to having the experience described above, the lead Structural
Engineering Design Reviewer shall be registered as a Structural Engineer (S.E.)
in California. Additional Structural Engineering Design Reviewers who work as
part of the Review team are not required to be registered Structural Engineers.
Geotechnical Engineering Reviewers
Geotechnical Engineering Reviewers shall have experience in geotechnical
engineering pertinent to the review scope and type of site and foundation. If
applicable to the review scope, they shall have experience in:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Design of shallow and/or deep foundation systems of the type proposed
for the project
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Interpretation of geotechnical and geological investigations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Soil-foundation-structure interaction under static (gravity) and seismic
loading conditions
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Liquefaction, landslides, and other geological site hazards
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Ground improvement
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Static and dynamic earth pressures
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Effects of dewatering on the project site and its vicinity
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Effects of construction-related activities on foundation performance of
neighboring structures
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Numerical modeling of geotechnical and seismic hazards, and associated
soil-structure interaction issues
In addition to having the experience described above, the lead Geotechnical
Engineering Reviewer shall be registered as a Geotechnical Engineer (G.E.) or a
Civil Engineer (C.E.) in California. Additional Geotechnical Engineering
Reviewers who work as part of the Review team are not required to be registered
Geotechnical or Civil Engineers.
Seismic Hazard and Ground Motion Reviewers
Reviewers of seismic hazard and ground motions shall have experience in these
fields pertinent to the review scope and the hazard and ground motion
approaches being used. If applicable to the review scope, they shall have
experience in:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†SFBC requirements related to hazard and ground motions
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Fault sources and characteristics in the San Francisco Bay Area
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Probabilistic and deterministic seismic hazard assessment
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Site effects and site response analysis
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Ground motion prediction equations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Selection and scaling of motions, and application of motions to a
structure
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Applicable research on seismic hazard and ground motion selection and
scaling
In addition to having the experience described above, the Reviewer of seismic
hazard and ground motions shall be registered as a Professional Engineer in
California or shall provide his or her services under the responsible charge of
a registered Professional Engineer on the Review team.
5.¬†¬†¬†PROJECTS REQUIRING REVIEW
The Director shall require Review for projects where Review is required by the
SFBC. The Director may require Review for other projects at the Director‚Äôs
discretion. Table 1 lists project characteristics commonly considered by the
Director in determining whether Review is required. Along with the
characteristics in Table 1, the Director‚Äôs determination of whether a project
requires Review, and what Review disciplines are required, may depend on
factors such as:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Size, importance, occupant load, post-earthquake functionality
requirements, or risk category of the structure
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Characteristics of the site, foundation system, and adjacent structures
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Irregular or unusual structural configurations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Pertinent qualifications within SFDBI to conduct an in-house review
¬†
Commentary: Project Sponsors are strongly encouraged to contact SFDBI early in the
project design process and to request a pre-application meeting with SFDBI and the
Engineer of Record to determine Review requirements. The SFDBI AB-028 ‚ÄúPre-
application and Pre-addendum Plan Review Procedures‚Äù specifies procedures for
requesting and carrying out such a meeting.

a Ground Motion Review is required whenever response-history analysis is used.
  Where Review is required by the SFBC, such review process shall also conform to
  the specific requirements of the SFBC. The SFBC references ASCE 7-16, which
b requires design review in Sections 16.5 (Seismic Response History Procedures),
  17.7 (Seismically Isolated Structures), and 18.5 (Structures with Damping
  Systems)
  The Director shall determine which Review disciplines are required based on
c which disciplines relate to the code requirements, code exceptions, or
  technologies proposed for the project.
  All projects of new buildings 240 feet or taller located in the City‚Äôs softest
  soils and/or liquefaction zones, as defined by the California Seismic Hazard
  Zone Map, released by the California Department of Conservation, Division of
d Mines and Geology, dated November 17, 2000, shall include two Geotechnical
  Reviewers on the Engineering Design Review Team unless the project will include
  piles/drilled piers anchored to bedrock. Only one Geotechnical Reviewer is
  required for a project that will anchor piles/piers to bedrock.
e Review of site-specific hazard is not required if the general (rather than site-
  specific) earthquake response spectrum is used.
f See commentary regarding Review of existing structures.
  Soils with potential for long-term consolidation settlement typically include
g normally to lightly overconsolidated clayey soils, such as Bay Mud and Old Bay
  Clay, though other soils may also exhibit such behavior.
  It is intended that most projects in this category would not require Review,
h except for major structures based on the list of considerations above this
  table.
¬†
¬†
Commentary: Review may be appropriate for the seismic evaluation or retrofit design of
existing structures when such an evaluation is carried out according to either (a)
SFEBC Section
304 .3.1, which reference the ASCE 41 standard, or (b) SFEBC Section
304 .3.2, which requires a lateral strength of 75%/100% of that required for new
buildings, sometimes assumed to be taken only in elements with structural detailing
conforming to current code requirements. Review issues applicable to existing
structures can include:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Establishing appropriate material properties.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Properly accounting for strength degradation, including acceptability limits for
degrading components.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Use of materials not covered in building codes, such as fiber-reinforced polymer
(FRP).
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For evaluations per SFEBC Section
304.3.2, evaluating the behavior and compatibility of existing elements, including
gravity framing.
¬†
6.¬†¬†¬†SCOPE OF REVIEW SERVICES
The scope of services for each Reviewer shall be approved by the Director. Each
Reviewer shall provide to the Director a written copy of the proposed scope of
services for the Reviewer‚Äôs contract with SFDBI. The proposed scope of services
in the contract and any changes proposed to be made thereto shall be approved
by the Director. The following describes possible review services for the
disciplines addressed in this bulletin.
Services common to all Review disciplines
The scope of services for Review disciplines addressed herein shall include the
following:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Define the scope of the Review.

provides the Reviewer‚Äôs professional opinion whether the aspects of the project
in the Reviewer‚Äôs purview are in conformance with criteria identified in the
scope of the Review. Prepare interim letters if required for partial
permitting.
At the discretion of the Director, the Review may be restricted to a single
aspect, such as seismic design of the structural system, or it may include
other aspects of design, such as design for wind resistance, design of special
foundation or earth retaining systems, or the structural bracing of important
non-structural elements.
The Review may cover design-build or contractor-designed items that affect
structural and geotechnical performance relevant to the intended scope of the
Review.
Structural Engineering Design Review services
If a Review of Structural Engineering Design is undertaken, the scope of
services shall indicate the aspects of design or structural elements (e.g.
seismic design, dampers, etc.) that are included in the Review. The scope of
services may include review of the following:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Structural performance goals
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Structural basis of design and overall concept
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Design methodology and acceptance criteria
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Mathematical modeling and simulation, including input assumptions
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Structural calculations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Interpretation of analysis results
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Design and detailing of members and systems
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Structural Construction Documents, including drawings, specifications,
and quality control and inspection provisions
Geotechnical Engineering Review services
If a Review of Geotechnical Engineering is undertaken, the scope of services
shall include review of geotechnical engineering methods and assumptions and
the geotechnical aspects of foundation design, as well as evaluation of the
recommendations regarding geotechnical aspects of construction, which may
include load testing and construction monitoring. This may include review of
the following:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Project geotechnical report, including draft versions as appropriate,
and the final report
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Geotechnical basis of design
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Plans and drawings for the selected foundation system, including below-
grade walls
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Pertinent calculations performed in support of geotechnical or
foundation recommendations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The proposed foundation system and its appropriateness for the structure
and ground conditions encountered at the site
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Allowable foundation bearing pressures for gravity, seismic, and other
relevant loading conditions
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Predicted foundation settlement, including expected and potential
variation, under anticipated gravity and seismic loading conditions

structures
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The proposed foundation load testing program and load test program
results
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The proposed quality control and quality assurance program for ground
improvement
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The proposed monitoring program for evaluating performance of shoring,
dewatering, adjacent buildings, and nearby improvements
¬†
Commentary: Often, design of ground improvement systems (e.g. deep soil mixing)
is performed by a design-build contractor. In that case, the design team should
provide to the Reviewers design-build contractor‚Äôs calculations demonstrating
that the ground improvement will perform as intended during the design ground
motions. The contractor‚Äôs ground improvement plan ‚Äì including test section,
quality control and quality assurance procedures, and post-improvement
verification field measurements ‚Äì should be reviewed by the Geotechnical
Engineering Reviewer.
If design of deep foundations is performed by a specialty deep foundation
contractor (e.g. torqued-in pipe piles), foundation performance criteria should
be established by the design team, and verification load test results should be
reviewed by the Geotechnical Engineering Reviewer.
¬†
Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Review services
If a Review of site-specific seismic hazard is undertaken, the scope of
services shall include the review of site-specific earthquake spectra, the
methods and assumptions used in development of the spectra, and SFBC
requirements. This may include the review of:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Fault sources, and associated magnitude ranges
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Site information and assumed shear wave velocity and other properties
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Application of ground motion prediction equations
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Adjustment for rupture directivity, orientation with respect to the
fault, basin effects, maximum direction effects, or other effects
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Site response analysis, including effect of the presence of deep
foundations and/or ground improvement on site response
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Comparison of spectra to code-minimum requirements
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Soil-foundation-structure interaction effects, where included in the
seismic hazard analysis
Earthquake Ground Motion Review services
The scope of services shall include the review of the motions to be used in the
design, their selection, scaling to response spectra, their duration, and SFBC
requirements. This may include review of:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Fault sources and characteristics
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The method used for scaling or matching and the period range for scaling
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Suitability related to record characteristics such as magnitude,
distance, mechanism, Vs 30 or other site parameters, scale factor, and the
presence and period of pulses
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Orbit plots of the horizontal components of the records
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The location and orientation of how the records are applied to the
structure
7.¬†¬†¬†REVIEW PROCESS
Schedule
Reviewers should be engaged as early in the design process as practical. This
affords Reviewers and the design team an opportunity to evaluate fundamental
design decisions, which could disrupt design development if addressed later in
the design phase. Early in the design process, the Engineer(s) of Record, a
representative of the Director, and the Reviewer(s) should convene a meeting to
establish the scope of the Review, the methods and lines of communication, the
timing of Review milestones, and the degree to which the Engineer(s) of Record
anticipates the design will be developed for each milestone.
Submittals by the Engineer(s) of Record to the Reviewer(s)
The Engineer(s) of Record shall provide design submittals to the Reviewer(s).
Submittals shall be organized and documented in a manner that facilitates
review by the Reviewer(s).
Where engineering software is used to perform structural or geotechnical
analysis, the Engineer of Record shall identify the version of software used
and shall indicate key assumptions and how the analysis is applied to the
project. The Engineer of Record shall, as requested, provide copies of data
input and output for the Reviewer(s) and shall indicate those aspects of the
output that govern the design. Where the software used is not commercially
available or commonly used in the industry for the purpose undertaken, the
Engineer of Record shall provide verification records indicating that the
software is capable of proper solution of analysis of the type performed on the
project. If the software is not available to the Reviewer(s) for the evaluation
of the input and interpretation of results, the Engineer of Record shall
provide such data as the Reviewer(s) deem necessary to perform verification
that the work is properly executed.
Comment log
Reviewer(s) shall provide written comments in a timely fashion to the Engineer
(s) of Record and to the Director, with requests for response as necessary. The
Engineer(s) of Record are responsible for responding to all comments. The
Reviewer(s) shall maintain a log that summarizes Reviewer comments, Engineer of
Record responses to comments, and resolution of comments. The Reviewer(s) shall
make the log available to the Engineer(s) of Record, the Director, and the
Project Sponsor as requested.
For projects designed to the prescriptive provisions of the SFBC, the comment
log may identify aspects of the project for which performance might be improved
by introducing design enhancements exceeding the minimum requirements of the
SFBC. It is not required for the design to be modified to comply with these
enhancements unless so directed by the Director.
Review findings reports
At the conclusion of the Review, and at other times requested by the Director,
the Reviewer(s) shall submit to the Director a written report documenting the
scope of the Review, the comment log, and the professional opinions of the
Reviewer(s) regarding the design‚Äôs conformance with the criteria identified in
the scope of the Review.
8.¬†¬†¬†DISPUTE RESOLUTION
The Engineer of Record and the Reviewer(s) shall interact in a professional
manner. Reviewers shall prepare comments in a respectful manner, shall prepare
in writing all requests for response, and shall make reasonable requests of the
Engineer of Record for additional evaluations or backup information. The
Engineer of Record shall respond clearly and completely to Reviewer comments.
The Engineer of Record and the Reviewer(s) shall attempt to develop a
resolution on each issue raised. If the Engineer of Record and the Reviewer(s)
are unable to resolve particular comments, the Reviewer(s) shall report the
impasse to the Director, and the Director shall give the Engineer of Record and
the Reviewer(s) the opportunity to explain their arguments.
The Director, as Building Official, makes all decisions concerning acceptance
of a design and issuance of permits. The responsibility of the Reviewer is
limited to providing his or her professional opinion to the Director. The
Director, should the need arise, may address differences of opinion between the
Engineer of Record and the Reviewer(s) in a method the Director deems
appropriate. The Director also may engage additional outside consultants to
assist in issue resolution.

DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬†:
¬†
1.¬†¬†¬†SCOPE
This bulletin presents requirements and guidelines for seismic structural
design and submittal documents for building permit for new tall buildings in
San Francisco that use non-prescriptive seismic design procedures.
¬†
Commentary: It is intended that buildings designed to the requirements and
guidelines of this bulletin will have seismic performance at least equivalent
to that intended of code-prescriptive seismic designs, consistent with the San
Francisco Building Code sections indicated below. To demonstrate that a
building design is capable of providing code equivalent seismic performance, a
three-step procedure shall be performed as specified in Section 4 of this
Administrative Bulletin. Intended code seismic performance can be found in the
commentary of FEMA 450.
This bulletin intentionally contains both requirements, which are stated in
mandatory language (e.g., ‚Äúshall‚Äù) and guidelines, which use non-mandatory
language.
This bulletin is not written to cover essential facilities.
For the purposes of this Administrative Bulletin, a non-prescriptive seismic
design is one that takes exception to one or more of the prescriptive
requirements of the San Francisco Building Code and
Chapter 12 of ASCE/SEI 7-16 and the standards referenced therein, by invoking
San Francisco Building Code, Section
104A.2.8, which allows alternative materials and methods of construction as
approved by the Building Official.
For the purposes of this bulletin, tall buildings are defined as those with hn
greater than 160 feet above average adjacent ground surface.
The height, hn is defined in the San Francisco Building Code as the height of
Level n above the average level of the ground surface adjacent to the
structure. Level n is permitted to be taken as the roof of the structure,
excluding mechanical penthouses and other projections above the roof whose mass
is small compared with the mass of the roof.
Procedures other than those presented herein may be acceptable pursuant to the
approval of the Director of the Department of Building Inspection.
¬†
Commentary: ASCE/SEI 7-16 Sections that discuss non-prescriptive or
‚Äúalternative‚Äù seismic design procedures are reproduced below:
11.1.4 Alternate Materials and Methods of Construction. Alternate materials and
methods of construction to those prescribed in the seismic requirements of this
standard shall not be used unless approved by the Authority Having
Jurisdiction. Substantiating evidence shall be submitted demonstrating that the
proposed alternate will be at least equal in strength, durability, and seismic
resistance for the purpose intended.
12.1.1 Basic Requirements. ‚Ä¶An approved alternative procedure shall not be used
to establish the seismic forces and their distribution unless the corresponding
internal forces and deformations in the members are determined using a model
consistent with the procedure adopted.
San Francisco Building Code sections that discuss non-prescriptive or
‚Äúalternative‚Äù seismic design procedures are reproduced below:
104A.2.8 Alternate materials, design and methods of construction. The
provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the use of any material,
alternate design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this
code, provided any alternate has been approved and its use authorized by the
building official.
The building official may approve any such alternate, provided the building
official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the
provisions of this code and that the material, method or work offered is, for
the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code
in suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety
and sanitation.
The building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be
submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding its use. The
details of any action granting approval of an alternate shall be recorded and
entered in the files of the code enforcement agency.
1604.4 Analysis. Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based
on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of
mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load
path capable of transferring loads and forces from their point of origin to the
load-resisting elements.
2.¬†¬†¬†STRUCTURAL DESIGN REVIEW
Structural Design Review shall be in accordance with
AB-082. At the conclusion of the review, the Structural Design Reviewer shall
provide a written statement that, in their professional opinion, the building
elements under their review are equivalent in strength, durability, and seismic
resistance of the building to those of a building designed according to the
prescriptive provisions of the San Francisco Building Code.
3.¬†¬†¬†SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
Project submittal documents shall be in accordance with the San Francisco
Building Code and Department of Building Inspection interpretations,
Administrative Bulletins, and policies. In addition, documents relevant to the
Structural Design Review shall be submitted by the Engineer of Record to the
Director and to the Structural Design Reviewer.
As early as practicable, the Engineer of Record shall submit to the Director an
initial Seismic Design Criteria along with a description and initial drawings
of the structure. The Seismic Design Criteria shall be consistent with the
requirements of this bulletin, and shall be updated to incorporate issues
resolved during the Structural Design Review process.
The Seismic Design Criteria shall describe the proposed building and structural
system, proposed analysis methodology, and acceptance criteria. The Seismic
Design Criteria shall include any proposed exceptions to the prescriptive
provisions of the San Francisco Building Code, modeling parameters, material
properties, drift limits, element force capacities and deformation capacities.
The Seismic Design Criteria shall identify all exceptions to the San Francisco
Building Code prescriptive requirements that the Engineer of Record proposes.
The Seismic Design Criteria shall be subject to review by the Structural Design
Reviewer and approval by the Director. A summary of the Engineer of Record‚Äôs
final Seismic Design Criteria shall be included in the general notes of the
structural drawings.
4.¬†¬†¬†SEISMIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
The Engineer of Record shall evaluate the structure at the levels of earthquake
ground motion as indicated in the subsections below.
If nonlinear response is anticipated under any of the Risk-Targeted Maximum
Considered Earthquake (MCER) ground motions specified in Section 4.3, the
Engineer of Record shall apply capacity design principles and design the
structure to have a suitable ductile yielding mechanism, or mechanisms, under
nonlinear lateral deformation. The code-level analysis shall be used to
determine the required strength of the yielding actions. The Engineer of Record
shall include in the Seismic Design Criteria all assumptions and factors used
in the application of capacity design principles.
¬†
Commentary: The purpose of each level of seismic evaluation is as follows:
The code-level evaluation of Section 4.1 is used to identify the exceptions
being taken to the prescriptive requirements of the San Francisco Building Code
and to define the minimum required strength and stiffness for earthquake
resistance. Minimum strength is defined according to San Francisco Building
Code minimum base shear equations, with a response modification coefficient R,
proposed by the Engineer of Record, reviewed by the Structural Design Reviewer,
and approved by the Director. Minimum stiffness is defined by requiring the
design to meet San Francisco Building Code-specified drift limits, using
traditional assumptions for effective stiffness. Providing a non-prescriptive
seismic design with minimum strength and stiffness comparable to code-
prescriptive designs helps produce seismic performance at least equivalent to
the code. Minimizing the number of exceptions to prescriptive requirements also
helps achieve this aim.
As indicated in Section 4.2, a service-level evaluation is required by this
bulletin to demonstrate acceptable seismic performance for moderate
earthquakes.
The MCE-level evaluation of Section 4.3 is intended to verify that the
structure has an acceptably low probability of collapse under severe earthquake
ground motions. The evaluation uses nonlinear response-history analysis to
demonstrate an acceptable mechanism of nonlinear lateral deformation and to
determine the maximum forces to be considered for structural elements and
actions designed to remain elastic.
4.1¬†¬†¬†Code-Level Evaluation
The seismic structural design shall be performed in accordance with the
prescriptive provisions of the San Francisco Building Code, except for those
provisions specifically identified by the Engineer of Record in the Seismic
Design Criteria as Code Exceptions.
¬†
Commentary: Code exceptions that have typically been taken for non-prescriptive
designs of tall buildings in high seismic design categories include exceeding the
height limitations of ASCE/SEI 7-16 Table 12.2.1. Other exceptions, including
provisions related to R,œÅ,Œ©0, limitations on T, and various detailing
requirements, may be considered at the discretion of the Director. The Engineer
of Record is required to justify all exceptions to prescriptive code provisions.
The scope of structural design review shall include all proposed code exceptions.
The lower limit of ASCE/SEI 7-16 Eq. 12.8-5 and 12.8-6 for the calculation of
the Seismic Response Coefficient applies to the scaling process of ASCE/SEI 7-
16 Section 12.9. The value of R used shall be indicated in the Seismic Design
Criteria, and shall not be greater than 8.5.
The Engineer of Record shall demonstrate that the structure meets the story
drift ratio limitations of the San Francisco Building Code using a code-level
response-spectrum analysis and the following requirements:
¬†¬†¬†a)¬†¬†¬†The design lateral forces used to determine the calculated drift need
not include the minimum base shear limitation of ASCE/SEI 7-16 eq. 12.8-5 and
12.8-6.
¬†¬†¬†b)¬†¬†¬†Stiffness properties of non-prestressed concrete elements shall not
exceed 0.5 times gross-section properties.
¬†¬†¬†c)¬†¬†¬†Foundation flexibility shall be considered, using recommendations
provided by the Geotechnical Engineer of Record that are defined in the Seismic
Design Criteria.
¬†¬†¬†d)¬†¬†¬†The analysis shall account for P-delta effects.
¬†
Commentary: ASCE/SEI 7-16 requires the consideration of the minimum base shear
of Eq. 12.8-5 and 12.8-6 for checking design story drifts relative to allowable
story drifts. However, the consensus of SEAONC‚Äôs
AB-083 Task Group for this Administrative Bulletin, approved by the SEAONC
Board, is that UBC Formula 30-7 (equivalent to ASCE/SEI 7-16 Eq. 12.8-6) need
not be applied to the check of drift limits for tall buildings designed
according to this bulletin, because the MCER-level Evaluation of Section 4.3
includes a check of drift for site-specific ground motions. Such ground motions
are required to take account of near-fault and directivity effects. The
consensus of the task group is that this is an appropriate and more explicit
way of addressing the intended purpose of applying Formula 30-7 to the check of
drift limits.
Actual concrete stiffness properties may vary significantly from the value of
0.5 times gross-section properties referenced for the code-level check of story
drift limits. This assumption is specified to provide a consistent requirement
for minimum building stiffness. This requirement is intended to lead to
earthquake serviceability performance related to story drift that is at least
comparable to that expected of prescriptively-designed tall buildings designed
to the San Francisco Building Code.
For the deformation compatibility evaluation of critical non-structural
elements, such as exterior curtain wall and cladding systems and egress
stairways, the drift ratio demand shall be calculated using the minimum base
shear limitations of ASCE/SEI 7-16 Eq. 12.8-5 and 12.8-6. In lieu of this
requirement, these critical non-structural elements may be designed for drift
ratios at the MCER-level .
4.2¬†¬†¬†Service-Level Evaluation
A service-level evaluation of the primary structural system is required to
demonstrate acceptable, essentially elastic seismic performance at the service-
level ground motion.
¬†
Commentary: To ensure code-equivalent seismic performance, the Director is
requiring a service-level evaluation for new tall buildings utilizing non-
prescriptive design procedures.
There are circumstances where there is a reason to believe that the
serviceability performance of the design would be worse than that anticipated
for a code-prescriptive design. Some of these circumstances have been
identified as follows:
a)¬†¬†¬†Where the Engineer of Record has taken any exception to code-prescriptive
requirements for non-structural elements (ASCE/SEI 7-16, Chapter 13)
b)¬†¬†¬†Where the stiffness representation of any structural element in the code-
level evaluation is significantly less than the effective linear-elastic
stiffness described in applicable research
c)¬†¬†¬†For a structure that exhibits disproportionably large drift or
accelerations for ground motions less than the San Francisco Building Code
Design Basis Ground Motion (not reduced by R).
While this bulletin does not require checking all non-structural elements at
the service-level evaluation, it is expected that the building cladding will
remain undamaged and that egress from the building will not be impeded when the
building is subjected to the service-level ground motion.
For the purposes of this bulletin, the service-level ground motion shall be
that having a 43-year mean return period (50% probability of exceedance in 30
years).
Structural models used in the service-level evaluation shall incorporate
realistic estimates of stiffness and damping considering the anticipated levels
of excitation and damage. The evaluation shall demonstrate that the elements
being evaluated exhibit serviceable behavior.
¬†
Commentary: While essentially elastic performance is required in the service-
level ground motion, it is not the intent of this bulletin to require that a
structure remain fully linear and elastic. It is permissible for the analysis
to indicate minor yielding of ductile elements of the primary structural
system, provided such results do not suggest appreciable permanent deformation
in the elements, strength degradation, or significant damage to the elements
requiring more than minor repair. It is permissible for the analysis to
indicate minor and repairable cracking of concrete elements.
Where numerical analysis is used to demonstrate serviceability, the analysis
model should represent element behavior that is reasonably consistent with the
expected performance of the elements. In typical cases it may be suitable to
use a linear response spectrum analysis, with appropriate stiffness and
damping, and with the earthquake demands represented by a linear response
spectrum corresponding to the service-level ground motion. Where response
history analysis is used, the selection and scaling of ground motion time
series should comply with the requirements of ASCE/SEI 7-16, Section 16.2, with
the service-level response spectrum used instead of the design basis earthquake
response spectrum, and with the design demand represented by the mean of
calculated responses for not less than seven appropriately selected and scaled
time series.
As expressed by SEAONC [1999], it should be understood ‚Äúthat the current state
of knowledge and available technology is such that the design profession‚Äôs
ability to accurately predict the earthquake performance of a specific building
is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties.‚Äù Actual performance may
differ from intended performance.
4.3¬†¬†¬†Risk-Targeted Maximum Considered Earthquake-Level Evaluation
Ground Motion: The ground motion representation for this evaluation shall be
the Risk-Targeted Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER) as defined in ASCE/SEI
7-16, Chapter 21.
A suite of not less than seven pairs of appropriate horizontal ground motion
time series shall be used in the analyses. The selection and scaling of these
ground motion time series shall comply with the requirements of ASCE/SEI 7-16,
Chapter 16, with the following modifications:
¬†¬†¬†a)¬†¬†¬†The MCER response spectrum shall be the basis for ground motion time
series scaling instead of the design response spectrum.
¬†¬†¬†b)¬†¬†¬†Either amplitude-scaling procedures or spectrum-matching procedures may
be used.
¬†¬†¬†c)¬†¬†¬†Where applicable, an appropriate number of the ground motion time
series shall include near fault and directivity effects such as velocity pulses
producing relatively large spectral ordinates at relatively long periods.
¬†
Commentary: The procedures for selecting and scaling ground motion records, as
presented here, represent the current state of practice. The procedures are
written to retain some flexibility so that engineering judgment can be used to
identify the best approach considering the unique characteristics of the site
and the building.
Selection and scaling of earthquake ground motion records for design purposes
is a subject of much current research. The Engineer of Record may wish to
consider alternative approaches recently proposed; however, some of the
proposed approaches have not been adequately tested on tall buildings so their
adoption should only be considered with caution. Aspects of particular concern
include the long vibration period of many tall buildings and the contributions
of multiple vibration ‚Äúmodes‚Äù to key response quantities.
At near-fault sites, the average fault-normal response spectrum usually is
larger than the average fault-parallel response spectrum due to the presence of
a rupture directivity pulse in the fault-normal component of the ground motion.
It is important to include in the suite of ground motions an appropriate number
of motions that include near-fault and directivity effects so that design drift
demands are appropriately determined, especially considering that Section 4.1
permits the design to be exempt from applying Equations 12.8-5 and 12.8-6 to
drift calculations. If spectral matching is used, individual ground motion
components should account for the distinction between fault-normal and fault-
parallel hazard.
Mathematical Model: The three-dimensional mathematical analysis model of the
structure shall conform to ASCE/SEI 7-16 Section 12.7.3.
The analyses shall consider the interaction of all structural and non-
structural elements that materially affect the linear and nonlinear response of
the structure to earthquake motions, including elements not designated as part
of the lateral-force-resisting system in the code-level analysis (Section 4.1).
¬†
Commentary: This requires explicit modeling of those parts of the structural
and non-structural systems that affect the dynamic response of the building. In
addition, the effect of building response on all materially affected parts of
the building must be evaluated.
The stiffness properties of reinforced concrete shall consider the effects of
cracking and other phenomena on initial stiffness.
¬†
Commentary: In addition to cracking, effective stiffness can be affected by
other phenomena. These include bond slip, yield penetration, tension-shift
associated with shear cracking, panel zone deformations, and other effects.
The effective initial stiffness of steel elements embedded in concrete shall
include the effect of the embedded zone. For steel moment frame systems, the
contribution of panel zone (beam-column joint) deformations shall be included.
The Engineer of Record shall identify any structural elements for which demands
for any of the response-history runs are within a range for which significant
strength degradation could occur, and shall demonstrate that these effects are
appropriately considered in the dynamic analysis.
¬†
Commentary: For typical situations, element strength degradation of more than
20% of peak strength should be considered significant.
P-Œî effects that include all the building dead load shall be included
explicitly in the nonlinear response history analyses.
Documentation submitted for Structural Design Reviewer review shall clearly
identify which elements are modeled linearly and which elements are modeled
nonlinearly. For elements that are modeled as nonlinear elements, submitted
documentation shall include suitable laboratory test results or analyses that
justify the hysteretic properties represented in the model.
The properties of elements in the analysis model shall be determined
considering earthquake plus expected gravity loads. In the absence of
alternative information, gravity load shall be based on the load combination
1.0D + Lexp, where D is the service dead load and Lexp is the expected service
live load.
¬†
Commentary: In typical cases it will be sufficient to take Lexp = 0.2L, where L
is the code-prescribed live load without live load reduction.
The foundation strength and stiffness contribution to the building seismic
response shall be represented in the model. The foundation strength and
stiffness characterization shall be consistent with the strength and stiffness
properties of the soils at the site, considering both strain rate effects and
soil deformation magnitude.
Analysis Procedure: Three-dimensional nonlinear response history (NLRH)
analyses of the structure shall be performed. Inclusion of accidental torsion
is not required. When the ground motion components represent site-specific
fault-normal ground motions and fault-parallel ground motions, the components
shall be applied to the three-dimensional mathematical analysis model according
to the orientation of the fault with respect to the building. When the ground
motion components represent random orientations, the components shall be
applied to the model at orientation angles that are selected randomly;
individual ground motion pairs need not be applied in multiple orientations.
¬†
Commentary: Three-dimensional analyses are required to represent the inherent
torsional response of the building to earthquake ground shaking. This is done
by including in the NLRH model the actual locations and distribution of the
building mass, stiffness, and strength. Accidental torsion is not required to
be included in the NLRH analyses. (Accidental torsion is required for the code-
level analysis of Section 4.1.)
The Engineer of Record shall report how damping effects are included in the
NLRH analyses. The equivalent viscous damping level shall not exceed 5%, unless
adequately substantiated by the Engineer of Record.
¬†
Commentary: The effects of damping in an analysis depend on the type of damping
model implemented. Some models may over-damp higher modes or have other
undesirable effects.
For each horizontal ground motion pair, the structure shall be evaluated for
the following load combination:
¬†¬†¬†1.0D + Lexp + 1.0E
Alternative load combinations, if used, shall be adequately substantiated by
the Engineer of Record.
Demands for ductile actions shall be taken not less than the mean value
obtained from the NLRH. Demands for low-ductility actions (e.g., axial and
shear response of columns and shear response of walls) shall consider the
dispersion of the values obtained from the NLRH.
¬†
Commentary: In typical cases the demand for low-ductility actions can be
defined as the mean plus one standard deviation of the values obtained from the
NLRH. Procedures for selecting and scaling ground motions, and for defining the
demands for low-ductility actions, should be defined and agreed to early in the
review process.
Acceptance Criteria: Calculated force and deformation demands on all elements
required to resist lateral and gravity loads shall be checked to ensure they do
not exceed element force and deformation capacities. This requirement applies
to those elements designated as part of the lateral-force-resisting system in
the code-level analysis (Section 4.1), as well as those elements not designated
as part of the lateral-force-resisting system in the code-level analysis but
deemed to be materially affected.
¬†
Commentary: Elements not designated as part of the lateral-force-resisting
system in the code-level analysis (gravity systems) may be subjected to
substantial deformations and forces, including axial forces accumulated over
many stories, as they interact with the primary lateral-force-resisting system.
Non-structural elements such as cladding are evaluated according to code
requirements. This bulletin does not require checking non-structural elements
at the MCER level.
The Engineer of Record shall identify the structural elements or actions that
are designed for nonlinear seismic response. All other elements and actions
shall be demonstrated by analysis to remain essentially elastic.
¬†
Commentary: Essentially elastic response may be assumed for elements when force
demands are less than design strengths. Design strengths for non-ductile
behaviors (e.g., shear and compression) of these essentially elastic elements
are defined as nominal strengths, based on specified material properties,
multiplied by strength reduction factors as prescribed in the SFBC. Design
strengths for ductile behaviors of these essentially elastic elements are
defined as nominal strengths, based on expected material properties, multiplied
by √∏=1.0. Alternative approaches to demonstrating essentially elastic response
may be acceptable where appropriately substantiated by the Engineer of Record.
For structural elements or actions that are designed for nonlinear seismic
response, the Engineer of Record shall evaluate the adequacy of individual
elements and their connections to withstand the deformation demands. Force and
deformation capacities shall be based on applicable documents or representative
test results, or shall be substantiated by analyses using expected material
properties.
The average result, over the NLRH analyses, of peak story drift ratio shall not
exceed 0.03 for any story.
All procedures and values shall be included in the Seismic Design Criteria and
are subject to review by the Structural Design Reviewer and approval by the
Director.

               Light-framed wood shear walls, when incorporated into a structure‚Äôs lateral
               force resisting system, will experience overturning forces arising from wind and
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬seismic loads on the structure. These overturning forces are typically resisted
               by the use of tiedown devices that anchor the ends of the shear walls to the
               foundation. The tiedown system shall either be ICC listed or meet all the
               requirements of this administrative bulletin.
¬†
A ‚Äúconventional‚Äù tiedown system typically utilizes cold-formed metal hardware
bolted to the wood end posts of the shear wall and anchored to the foundation.
Tensile overturning forces are carried by the wood end posts. A ‚Äúcontinuous
tiedown‚Äù system utilizes a continuous or coupled rod or cable assembly
comprising bearing plates, shrinkage compensating devices, and couplers,
wherein tensile overturning forces are carried by the rod(s) or cable(s) not
the wood end posts.
Continuous tiedown systems are not explicitly addressed by current prescriptive
code requirements.
Requirements:
Plan check review and approval of continuous tiedown systems for any project
shall be on a case-by-case basis in accordance with this Administrative
Bulletin. The following requirements shall be the basis for plan check review
and approval of continuous tiedown systems used within light-framed wood shear
wall systems:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Shear walls shall be designed to comply with the drift requirements of
ASCE 7-16 Section 12.8.6. Shear wall displacements shall be computed in
accordance with CBC Section 2305.3. The component ‚Äúda‚Äù of Equation 23-2 in CBC
Section 2305.3 shall include, but not be limited to, elongation of the rod or
cable, and deformations and displacements of shrinkage compensating devices,
coupling hardware and steel bearing plates.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†In a multi-story shear wall installation, the continuous tiedown system
shall be restrained by bearing plates at each story of the multi-story shear
wall. Skipping of stories, where bearing plates are omitted at intermediate
stories, resulting in multiple stories being tied together, is prohibited.
Shrinkage compensating devices shall be provided at each story of the shear
wall.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†The computed rod or cable elongation or stretch, together with computed
deformations of shrinkage compensating device in compliance with ICC AC-316,
coupling hardware steel bearing plate and crushing of wood top plates, within
any story under strength level (Load and Resistance Factor Design) short-term
duration loading, such as wind or earthquake loads, shall not exceed 0.250
inch, and for working stress level (Allowable Stress Design) short-term
loading, they shall not exceed 0.179 inch. Elongation or stretch shall be
computed as the product PL/EAe, where P is the axial load (pounds), L is the
initial rod or cable length at the story under consideration (inches), E is the
rod or cable modulus of elasticity (psi), and Ae is the effective tensile cross
sectional area of the rod or cable (in2).
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Calculations demonstrating compliance with the foregoing shall be
provided for plan check review.
¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†Construction documents, signed and sealed by the engineer of record for
the design of the building, shall specify the particular proprietary system or
systems.
¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†Any modification to the tiedown system proposed after a building permit
has been approved shall require filing of a new permit application documenting
the proposed modification. Plan check review of the proposed modification shall
be in accordance with the requirements of this Administrative Bulletin.
¬†¬†¬†7.¬†¬†¬†Mixing of conventional and continuous tiedown systems within shear
walls along a common line is prohibited.
¬†¬†¬†8.¬†¬†¬†In addition to other inspections required by SFBC
1705, special inspection of continuous tiedown systems shall be provided. In
addition to structural observations required by SFBC
1704.6, the engineer of record for the design of the building shall provide
structural observation of continuous tiedown installations, including shear
wall boundary nailing, shear wall end post sizes, bearing plates, couplers,
shrinkage compensating devices, and anchor bolts, to verify conformance of the
installed tiedown system to the structural design intent.

DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬†:
¬†
The City and County of San Francisco enforces state and local codes regarding
Solid Waste Reuse and Recycling. These codes will help meet locally zero waste
commitments of reducing total generation of solid waste in 2030 by at least 15%
below 2015 levels, and reduction in solid waste disposal of at least 50% below
2015 levels.
For the purpose of enforcement of these regulations in San Francisco, recycled
materials are those which are diverted or recovered from the solid-waste
stream. The word trash refers to materials that are non-recyclable and non-
compostable.
This Administrative Bulletin details procedures for local enforcement of the
requirements of state and local policies. These include the Model Ordinance
adopted by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, Resolution 93-57
regarding Areas for Collecting and Loading Recyclable Materials in Development
Projects. State law prohibited the issuance of permits for certain development
projects after July 1, 2005 unless adequate space is provided for collection,
storage, and conveyance of such materials. In addition, San Francisco
Environment Code Chapter 19, Mandatory Recycling and Composting:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Requires all persons in San Francisco to separate and deposit all
recyclables, compostables or trash in appropriate containers designated for
each type of refuse;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Requires owners or managers of multifamily or commercial properties to
provide adequate refuse collection service to tenants, employees, contractors,
and customers of these properties; and
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Requires containers of appropriate number and size for the recyclable,
compostable, and trash quantities reasonably anticipated to be generated at the
location, with collection containers placed as close together as possible in
order to provide all occupants with convenient access to containers designated
for each type of refuse.
Well-designed refuse collection areas support successful participation in San
Francisco‚Äôs mandatory recycling and composting programs that will apply when
the building is completed.
General Requirements:
Applicability
As detailed in the Model Ordinance and California Green Building Standards Code
The following projects or portions of projects are required to provide adequate
areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials, compostable organics,
and trash:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Newly constructed non-residential buildings (CalGreen 5.410.1);
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Newly constructed residential buildings with 5 or more dwelling units
(CalGreen 4.410.2);
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded, and
any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading
solid waste;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†A new subdivision or tract of single-family detached homes if solid
waste is collected and loaded in a location that services five or more living
units;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Any one of the above types of projects that is existing to which an
addition is made that adds 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of the
project;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Any one of the above types of projects that is existing to which
multiple additions are made over a one-year period that cumulatively add 30
percent or more to the existing floor area of the project;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Any one of the above types of projects, occupied by multiple tenants, to
which one or more tenant improvements are made under building permit over a
one-year period by any one tenant that adds 30 percent or more to that tenant‚Äôs
leased area, in which case that tenant‚Äôs leased area shall be provided with
sufficient recycling areas;
Solid-waste collection methods and storage
In accordance with the City and County of San Francisco‚Äôs zero waste goal and
targets and to facilitate compliance with mandatory recycling and composting
requirements that will apply to the building when it is completed, the amount
of space provided for the collection and storage of recyclable and compostable
materials shall be sufficient to allow recovery of 100 percent of the
facility‚Äôs recyclable and compostable materials and any remaining trash. Space
shall be sufficient to accommodate containers consistent with both current
methods and percentages of solid-waste storage and removal, and with projected
needs when San Francisco‚Äôs zero waste goal is met.
All areas designated for the collection and loading of recyclable, compostable
and trash materials shall be integrated into the design and, when appropriate,
the structure of the project. Areas for recyclable and compostable materials
shall be at least as convenient and usable as spaces provided for non-
recyclable and non-compostable trash disposal, and shall be located in the same
areas whenever possible. When separate locations must be provided due to space
constraints, the locations for collection of recyclable and compostable
materials shall be at least as convenient as trash disposal locations.
Each dwelling unit in a covered project shall include areas within the dwelling
unit designed and designated for storage of recyclable, compostable and trash
materials.
Any chute system for solid-waste disposal in a covered project must be designed
for equal convenience to all users to separate the three refuse streams of
trash, recycling and compostable materials.
Guidance on Recycling Design

               2022 San Francisco Building Code
               Approved construction documents and completed projects must conform to the Green
               Building requirements established in the San Francisco Green Building Code, which
               combines all mandatory elements of the 2022 California Green Building Standards
               Code (‚ÄúCALGreen‚Äù) and stricter local requirements.
               Herein, ‚Äúlocally required measures‚Äù refers to the combination of prescriptive
               measures required by the California Green Building Standards Code, local
               amendments, and other relevant local requirements.
               At various project milestones, particularly at the conclusion of construction,
               the Department of Building Inspection must verify that Green Building
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬requirements have been met. Under these implementation procedures, the majority
               of verification is required to be provided to the Department of Building
               Inspection via a formal third-party certification under green building rating
               systems referenced in the San Francisco Green Building Code, or by a third-party
               licensed design professional.
               Note: Future local, state or other regulations may change the scope and
               implementation of Green Building requirements. Projects that submit a complete
               application for a building permit must meet the requirements in effect at that
               time. Project sponsors should verify that they are meeting all applicable code
               requirements, which may modify the standards and procedures addressed in this
               Administrative Bulletin.
¬†
IMPLEMENTATION:
Green Building Requirements to be Applied
The San Francisco Green Building Code applies to all new construction in San
Francisco, as well as most alterations and additions. To identify the green
building requirements which apply to a project:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Use Attachment A, Table 1 of this bulletin to find the overall green
building standard [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED),
GreenPoint Rated, or ‚ÄòLocally Required Measures Only‚Äô] that applies, based on
occupancy, project size, and whether the project is new construction or
alteration. Attachment A, Table 1 also identifies the submittal required in
order to confirm compliance with local requirements.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Attachment B consists of four tables that summarize specific required
measures:1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Table 1: Requirements for projects meeting a LEED standard
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Table 2: Requirements for projects meeting a GreenPoint Rated
standard
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Table 3: Requirements for all non-residential projects that are not
required to meet a LEED standard (includes certain new construction as well as
certain additions and alterations)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Table 4: Requirements for residential additions and alterations
Mixed Occupancy Buildings
For mixed occupancy buildings where local standards reference a green building
rating system (Attachment A, Table 1), the project sponsor may apply a single
green building rating system to the entire building. Each portion of the
building must meet the Local Requirements applicable to that occupancy.
Applicability of Green Building Regulations Based on Date of Building Permit
Application
Application of Green Building requirements is based on the date of submittal of
a building permit application. The applicable date of the San Francisco Green
Building Code 2022 is January 1, 2023. In the case of Site Permits, the
effective date shall be the date that the Site Permit application (not an
addendum) is filed with the Department of Building Inspection.
Table 1 summarizes the green building requirements that apply based on the date
a complete application is submitted. Addenda to site permits and revisions to
permit applications received before January 1, 2023 are required to meet the
green building requirements that applied on the date a complete application for
site permit was submitted. If a site permit addendum or revision changes the
scope of the project such that current codes are generally applicable, then
current green building requirements are also applicable.

PROJECT SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
Applicability
Attachment A, Table 1 should be used to determine which green building
requirements may apply to the project. Department of Building Inspection staff
will screen all building permit applications to confirm which Green Building
regulations apply, as summarized in Attachment A, Table 1. Every application
for a Site Permit subject to these regulations must include a completed Green
Building Site Permit Submittal (GS-1). Permit applications for new construction
projects will not be accepted for processing without Green Building Site Permit
Submittal GS-1, and permit applications for an addition or alteration will not
be accepted without submittal GS-2, GS-3, GS-4, GS-5, or GS-6 as applicable.
At the time of the first architectural or superstructure addendum, whichever
comes first, the submittal package for all applicable projects must include a
checklist incorporated into the project plans indicating the required green
building measures.2 This checklist must reference, as appropriate, location of
green building features in the submittal documents. The Green Building
Submittal (GS-1, GS-2, GS-3, GS-4, GS-5, or GS-6) shall include this checklist,
shall detail the green building requirements to be met, and shall indicate
which addendum or other document will provide compliance details for each
required performance measure or credit.
The Green Building Submittal may be reformatted as needed to conform to plan
submittal size if all information is provided.
Compliance with the Green Building Requirements may be documented in any of the
following methods:
¬†¬†¬†1)¬†¬†¬†Registration and submittal for certification under LEED. For buildings
that propose this option, the permit applicant must provide submittal
documentation showing that the project will meet the appropriate LEED
certification requirements. See the ‚ÄúEnergy Compliance Guidelines for LEED
projects‚Äù section below for details about energy compliance.
¬†¬†¬†2)¬†¬†¬†Registration and achievement of GreenPoint Rated status. For buildings
that propose this option, the permit applicant must submit documentation
showing that the project meets all requirements necessary for GreenPoint Rated
certification.
¬†¬†¬†3)¬†¬†¬†Documentation of compliance with either LEED or GreenPoint Rated
standards without registration and certification from those systems. The Green
Building Compliance Professional of Record must provide submittal documentation
showing that the project will meet the appropriate standards.
¬†¬†¬†4)¬†¬†¬†Registration and submittal for another rating system or documentation
of equivalency as approved by the Director. For buildings that propose to meet
such alternate standards, the Green Building Compliance Professional of Record
must provide submittal documentation detailing compliance with the proposed
standards.
¬†¬†¬†5)¬†¬†¬†Where neither LEED nor GreenPoint Rated is required, submit
documentation of compliance with Locally Required Measures in effect at the
time of permit submittal, as indicated.
Municipal projects3 of 10,000 square feet or larger are required to obtain LEED
Gold certification by San Francisco Environment Code, Chapter 7. For such
projects, only method 1) above may be used.
Green Building Compliance Professional of Record
For methods 3), 4), and 5) above, the owner or owner‚Äôs agent must employ a
Green Building Compliance Professional of Record who personally reviews and
verifies compliance with San Francisco Green Building Code requirements, or who
directly supervises persons providing on-site review or verification thereof.
For methods 3), 4), and 5) above, the qualifications for Green Building
Compliance Professional of Record include a license or registration as an
Architect or Engineer, and specialized understanding of Green Building
standards and technologies:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†for LEED projects, such specialized understanding shall include LEED
accreditation and successful completion of at least one LEED certified project
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†for GreenPoint Rated projects, such specialized understanding shall
include the GreenPoint Rater designation, or the project team shall include a
person who is a GreenPoint Rater.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For projects solely required to meet Locally Required Measures, such
specialized understanding, shall include either: International Code Council
(ICC) Certified CalGreen Inspector certification, the GreenPoint Rater
designation, LEED accreditation, or equivalent training and certification as
approved by the Director.
For residential alteration and addition projects where the area of the project
is less than 25,000 square feet and which increase total conditioned floor area
of the building by no more than 1,000 square feet, a Green Building Compliance
Professional of Record is not required.4 In such cases, the applicant may
complete the green building submittal. In all cases, applicable green building
requirements apply to the entire project, and are not limited to the area of
addition.
The Department of Building Inspection may request verification of such training
or experience and may make an administrative determination as to the
qualification of a person to act as such a Green Building Compliance
Professional of Record.
A Green Building Compliance Professional of Record is responsible for providing
verification to the Department of Building Inspection that all Green Building
design and construction requirements are met. Where a Green Building Compliance
Professional of Record is responsible for verifying compliance with the
requirements of the San Francisco Green Building Code, and no third party green
building certification is to be achieved, project documents may be reviewed in
detail in plan review and inspection, at standard hourly rates for staff time.
Compliance Guidelines: Energy
The 2022 San Francisco Green Building Code requires building permit submittals
to show that they meet the compliance margin required by the applicable rating
system or local code, and comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency
Standards in effect at the time of permit submittal. In each case below,
standard California Energy Standards documentation must be prepared using
software approved by the California Energy Commission for demonstrating
compliance with the applicable provisions and version of the California Energy
Code. The following guidelines explain when additional calculations and
documentation are required.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Buildings meeting a LEED for Building Design and Construction (BD+C), or
LEED Core and Shell standard for compliance with the San Francisco Green
Building Code must prepare and submit all standard documentation required by
the California Energy Commission to demonstrate compliance with the California
Energy Standards (Title 24, Part 6) in effect on the date of permit
application.6
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Where calculations based on Title 24 Part 6 California Energy Standards
are used to document that ‚Äòpoints‚Äô are earned for energy efficient design and
construction, the compliance margin cited in the applicable certificate of
compliance (CF1R-PRF-01E for single family and NRCC-PRF-01 for commercial and
multifamily) submitted for compliance may be utilized without modification.
Residential all-electric buildings which demonstrate prescriptive compliance
and apply GreenPoint Rated J5.1 Option Two: All Electric Compliance may submit
the applicable CF1R or NRCC report.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Where the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-
Conditioning Engineers (ASRHAE) 90.1 option in LEED v4 (or subsequent) rules is
used to document ‚Äòpoints‚Äô being voluntarily earned for energy-efficient design
and construction, the supporting analysis must be submitted, and must include a
detailed accounting of all on-site building energy use, including all: exterior
and security lighting; elevators; process loads; and receptacle loads.
Documentation to be retained in the records of the project must include all
information required for LEED certification by the Green Building Certification
Institute.
Buildings meeting a LEED for Homes or GreenPoint Rated standard must use
California Energy Commission-approved compliance software and submit
documentation to demonstrate that the proposed building both:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Complies with the California Energy Efficiency Standards in effect on
the date of application for building permit, AND
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Meets the minimum energy performance requirements of the applicable
green building rating system.
Where California Energy Commission-approved compliance software is used to
document the minimum energy efficiency requirements of the green building
rating, all submittals related to compliance and the green rating system must
be generated in a manner consistent with the guidance of the applicable green
building rating system, and must faithfully represent the design as proposed.
The most straightforward way to demonstrate compliance calculations are
consistent with the calculations of the green building rating system is to use
a single simulation run, so that the compliance run number is consistent
throughout the compliance documentation.
Compliance Guidelines: All-Electric New Construction
San Francisco Building Code
106A.1.17.1 requires all-electric design and construction for all projects that
submitted an initial application for permit to construct new buildings on or
after June 1, 2021. All space-conditioning, water heating, cooking, and clothes
drying systems must be all-electric, and installation of infrastructure, piping
systems, or piping for distribution of natural gas or propane to such uses
indoors or outdoors is prohibited. The ordinance allows limited installation of
gas piping systems for commercial food preparation, and if, after exhausting
all options, all-electric construction is determined to be physically or
technically infeasible. See Administrative Bulletin
112 for details.
Compliance Guidelines: Construction Site Runoff Pollution Prevention
Construction site runoff pollution prevention requirements depend upon project
size, occupancy, and location in areas served by combined or separate sewer
systems. Projects required to meet a LEED standard (see Attachment A, Table 1)
must, at a minimum, prepare an erosion and sedimentation control plan per LEED
Sustainable Sites prerequisite 1. However, more stringent local requirements
may apply to any project, whether or not LEED is to be applied, such as a
stormwater soil loss prevention plan or a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP). To confirm the construction site runoff pollution prevention
requirements applicable to your project, please contact the SFPUC: sfpuc.org/
programs/pretreatment-program/construction-site-runoff.
Compliance Guidelines: Design for Post-Construction Stormwater Management
Projects that disturb 5,000 square feet or more of ground surface in the
separate and combined sewer areas, or that create or replace 2,500 square feet
or more of impervious surface in separate sewer areas, must meet Stormwater
Management Requirements as determined by the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC), and must submit a Stormwater Control Plan to the SFPUC for
approval. The SFPUC has developed San Francisco Stormwater Management
Requirements and Design Guidelines to aid project teams in meeting local
requirements for stormwater controls, which are available online at: sfpuc.org/
construction-contracts/design-guidelines-standards/water-efficient-landscape.
Compliance Guidelines: Water Efficient Irrigation
Projects that include at least 500 square feet of new or modified landscape are
subject to the San Francisco Water Efficient Irrigation Ordinance.7 Details are
available online at: sfpuc.org/smr.
New Large Commercial Interiors and Major Alterations to Existing Buildings
The application of San Francisco Green Building Code Sections 5.103.3 or
4.103.3 to Major Alterations to Existing Buildings is based on a determination
as to whether a ‚Äúsignificant upgrade‚Äù is proposed to both the structural system
and to one or more of the mechanical, electrical and/or plumbing systems in an
area of more than 25,000 gross square feet in a Group B, M or R occupancy. For
the purpose of enforcement of the San Francisco Green Building Code, a
significant structural upgrade shall be determined to take place when a
structural alteration takes place in thirty percent or more of the area of
proposed construction. Areas to be counted toward such a determination include
areas tributary to the vertical load carrying components (joists, beams,
columns, walls and other structural components) that have been or will be
removed, added or altered.
The application of Section 5.103.4 to New Large Commercial Interiors requires
that the first time tenant improvement work in an area of at least 25,000
square feet must meet the green building standards detailed in the ordinance.
This requirement applies regardless of the date of construction of the
building, including the first time a space undergoes a tenant improvement after
or concurrent with a major alteration as defined in San Francisco Green
Building Code Section 202. Note that all first-time commercial tenant interior
improvement work of less than 25,000 square feet must comply with all
applicable CALGreen requirements; see Attachment B Table 3 or Green Submittal
Form GS-3 for details.
Historic Building Requirements for ‚ÄúHistoric Resources‚Äù Based on Planning
Department Determination
For purposes of applying the specific provisions of San Francisco Green
Building Code related to historic buildings, the Planning Department shall
determine whether a building is a historical resource. This Planning Department
review applies a standard based on the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) as to whether a structure is or might be considered a historic resource.
Based on such information, the Green Building Compliance Professional of Record
shall confirm that submittal documents properly reflect the requirements of the
Code.
Projects which retain, rehabilitate or repair significant historical
architectural features may receive credit toward Green Building requirements,
per Attachment A, Table 3.
Alternate Building Code Applicability Under the California Historical Building
Code Based on Department of Building Inspection Qualification
For buildings that are qualified to use the California Historical Building
Code, project sponsors may apply the alternate provisions of that code.
Buildings are determined to be qualified to use the California Historical
Building Code upon specific request to the Department of Building Inspection.
Buildings that qualify to use the California Historical Building Code include
buildings that are on federal, state or local adopted lists or surveys, or
buildings that are determined by the City to be eligible for such a list or
survey, or buildings that have otherwise been determined by the City to be
potential historic resources. The applicant must confirm with the Department of
Building Inspection whether code provisions for historic buildings will be
applied to the entire building, specific items, or specific areas.
Eligibility to use the California Historical Building Code is a separate
process from the determination by the Planning Department that a building is a
historic resource, but the Department of Building Inspection coordinates with
the Planning Department on the review of requests for qualification to use the
California Historical Building Code.
Demolition
For a replacement building which is to be constructed on a site on which one or
more buildings were demolished after the effective date of this ordinance, the
Planning Department, during the course of permit review, shall confirm
applicable Green Building requirements, as found in Attachment A, Table 2.
Requests for Approval of Equivalencies
Project sponsors wishing to propose alternates or equivalencies for the
specific requirements referenced in the San Francisco Green Building Code or
its referenced standards may do so as described in Administrative Bulletin 5,
‚ÄúProcedures for Approval of Local Equivalencies.‚Äù Note that related state and
local requirements continue to apply, including but not limited to: California
Green Building Standards Code (Title 24 Part 11); SFPUC Stormwater Management
Ordinance; and SFPUC Water Efficient Irrigation Ordinance.
A proposal for an alternate or equivalent method of compliance may be submitted
with initial permit application or at a later date. Proposals for alternate or
equivalency to San Francisco Green Building Code must include:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Proposed approach. If more than one equivalency is proposed, each
alternate must be presented separately.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Requests must be accompanied by a complete analysis of Green Building
Code and other code-related issues, and must be recommended by and signed by
the Green Building Compliance Professional of Record for the project. The
analysis must include calculations or other documentation for each specific
element, confirming that the proposal meets or exceeds the applicable
requirements.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†The Department of Building Inspection staff will review the equivalency
and may, at its discretion, request review by other City staff or outside
professionals expert in the matter under review. The project sponsor will be
responsible for all additional costs incurred for such review, including review
time by City staff, charged at the hourly rate as set forth in the San
Francisco Building Code, or direct costs for other consultant review.
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†The Department of Building Inspection staff may request additional
information as part of the review.
¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†The Department of Building Inspection will issue a decision to approve,
deny or require modifications to any submitted alternate or equivalency.
¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†Project sponsors may appeal any decision to the Deputy Director,
Director, and appeal bodies as detailed in the San Francisco Building Code.
Note that the 2022 San Francisco Green Building Code recognized GreenPoint
Rated v.9 and all LEED v4 rating systems (see SFGBC
101.10), and allows the application of more recent versions of these rating
systems. New residential projects of any size may therefore utilize LEED for
Homes Midrise, LEED BD+C, or GreenPoint Rated without triggering the above
process for confirming equivalency. Similarly, major alterations to residential
buildings may use LEED for Building Design and Construction, GreenPoint Rated
Multifamily New Home, or GreenPoint Rated Multifamily Existing Home to comply,
provided applicable local requirements are met.
Project Completion: Verification that Green Building Requirements are Met
Verification that green building requirements have been met requires either
submittal of Attachment E, Green Building: Final Compliance Verification, or
submittal of final certification as meeting LEED or GreenPoint Rated
requirements, or both. Final Compliance Verification documentation is required
prior to final inspection. Attachment E may be completed using any of the
following methods:
¬†¬†¬†1)¬†¬†¬†If the project has been submitted for certification under LEED, the
project shall provide documentation that Green Building Certification Institute
has certified the project.
¬†¬†¬†2)¬†¬†¬†If the project has been submitted to be GreenPoint Rated, the project
shall provide documentation that Build It Green has provided a GreenPoint Rated
certificate to the project.
¬†¬†¬†3)¬†¬†¬†If the project is built to meet LEED or GreenPoint Rated standards but
will not be certified, then Attachment E must be signed by the Green Building
Compliance Professional of Record.
¬†¬†¬†4)¬†¬†¬†If the project is built to meet locally required measures, then
Attachment E must be signed by the Green Building Compliance Professional of
Record. For residential alteration and addition projects which increase total
conditioned floor area of the building by no more than 1,000 square feet, the
applicant may sign the green building submittal, and a Green Building
Compliance Professional of Record is not required.
¬†¬†¬†5)¬†¬†¬†If the Director has approved an equivalency per AB-005, the project
must provide documentation that the approved approach has been applied. For
such buildings, Attachment E must be signed by the Green Building Compliance
Professional of Record.
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy
A Temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued pending final compliance
certification. However, no final Certificate of Completion may be issued until
Green Building Final Compliance Verification (Attachment E of this bulletin)
has been received, reviewed and accepted by the Department of Building
Inspection.
Quality Assurance and Compliance Review
All projects are subject to comprehensive review by the Department of Building
Inspection or its agents. Project sponsors must maintain comprehensive records
to allow verification that all requirements have been met. Buildings that
receive certification through LEED or GreenPoint Rated will generally be
accepted as being fully compliant. The Department of Building Inspection may
review any aspect of green building project.
Failure to Comply with Green Building Requirements
Failure to meet all required Green Building requirements will subject a project
sponsor to all enforcement and abatement remedies detailed in the San Francisco
Building Code.

               A clear definition of ‚Äúsoft-story Type V (wood-frame) building‚Äù and the basic
               design criteria for seismic upgrades to such buildings are essential to the
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬permit submittal and approval of projects that wish to take advantage of City-
               sponsored voluntary incentives to implement seismic upgrades of potentially
               seismically hazardous buildings.
¬†
Permits for voluntary structural work that do not reference meeting a specific
code standard or that do not qualify for incentives for voluntary seismic
upgrade work permit processing may meet any level of upgrade if such work does
not increase the hazard of the building.
Chapter 5E of the San Francisco Existing Building Code requires the mandatory
retrofit of Soft Story Type V (wood-frame) buildings, built prior to 1978 with
2 or more stories over a weak story and having 5 or more residential units.
Buildings falling within the scope of SFEBC Chapter 5E are not eligible for the
incentives offered in this bulletin. The application and incentives of
AB-094 apply to buildings with 4 or fewer residential units or other occupancy
classifications.
IMPLEMENTATION
Building owners who wish to take advantage of voluntary seismic upgrade
incentives must meet the definition of a soft-story Type V (wood-frame)
building and must comply with the retrofit standards as detailed below.
DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this Administrative Bulletin the following definitions shall
apply:
Soft-story Type V (wood-frame) building means a building that meets the
following criteria:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†a Type V (wood-frame) building as defined in the San Francisco Building
Code, and
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†was constructed prior to May 21, 1973, and
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†has a ground floor (1st story) level in which
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†a.¬†¬†¬†at least 50% of the floor area of the ground floor is used for
Occupancy Classifications A (assembly), B (business), M (mercantile), S
(storage, open or enclosed parking garages), or U (private garages), or
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†the building has been determined to have either a Weak Story or Soft
Story deficiency when evaluated using the ASCE 31 Tier 2 procedure, or
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†the building has been determined to have a soft-story deficiency
based on engineering analysis acceptable to the Building Official.
RETROFIT STANDARDS
The standards to be applied to the seismic upgrade of soft-story wood-framed
buildings in order to qualify for voluntary upgrade incentives shall be one of
the following:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of Appendix A -
Chapter A4 of the California Existing Building Code, CEBC, or
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of ASCE 41 for the Partial Rehabilitation
Objective (Section 1.4.3) (Life Safety Performance Level: S-3) in the BSE-
1 earthquake hazard level, or
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Meets any other alternate rational design and/or construction
methodology that demonstrates compliance with the intent of San Francisco
Existing Building Code Section
304.4. For qualified historic buildings, seismic upgrade designs may use the
provisions and analysis techniques referenced in the California Historical
Building Code, Chapter 8-7, Structural Regulations, and Chapter 8-8, Archaic
Materials and Methods of Construction to assist in meeting the retrofit
standards.
For the purposes of this bulletin, mitigation of the soft-story conditions at
the ground floor (1st story) shall be considered the part of the voluntary
soft-story wood-frame upgrade work eligible for incentives. Additional seismic
upgrade work may be undertaken on the floors above the ground floor; however
such additional seismic retrofit work is not considered part of the voluntary
soft-story upgrade work and will be subject to standard permitting
requirements.
PERMIT PROCESSING
Submittal Documents and Building Permit Application
Building permit applications for voluntary, soft-story Type V (wood-frame)
building upgrade work must clearly state the intention to qualify for voluntary
incentives in the Project Description portion of the building permit
application form. Submittal documents should include the following:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Dimensioned plans showing all exterior walls, interior partitions and
any lateral load-resisting, or plans showing Occupancy Classifications and uses
of the ground floor if that is the method of qualifying as a soft-story
building under this Administrative Bulletin, and
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†A photograph of the building exterior, and
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Structural upgrade plans and necessary supporting calculations and
documents prepared by a licensed design professional showing how seismic
upgrade will meet the standards adopted in this Administrative Bulletin.
Included in these submittal documents should be a listing of archaic materials
and values for those materials, if these are to be used as part of the lateral
force resisting system.
Expedited Permit Processing
Building permit applications for voluntary soft-story wood-frame seismic
retrofit will be expedited as authorized under
AB-004 and will be tracked by the Department of Building Inspection for
reporting purposes.

               4 Report), http://www.sfcapss.org/PDFs/PostQuakeRepair.pdf
               San Francisco Existing Building Code Section 405.2.3.1 triggers seismic
               evaluation, and possibly retrofit of buildings, when earthquake-related damage
               reaches the level of ‚Äúsubstantial structural damage to vertical elements of the
               lateral-force-resisting system.‚Äù Substantial structural damage is defined in
               Section
               202 as, in essence, a loss of lateral capacity of 20 percent or more in any
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬horizontal direction. The code does not give specific rules for identifying a
               20-percent capacity loss nor guidance as to how to calculate capacity loss, so
               implementation of these code provisions relies on interpretation by the
               Department of Building Inspection. This Bulletin presents the Department‚Äôs
               interpretation of 20-percent lateral capacity loss in terms based on visual
               indicators of such damage, and details the scope of required retrofit for
               buildings that exhibit earthquake-induced substantial structural damage.
¬†
In addition to substantial structural damage, San Francisco Existing Building
Code Section 405.2 triggers structural evaluation and possibly retrofit when
earthquake-related damage reaches the level of disproportionate damage, which
is defined in Section 202 as, in essence, a lateral capacity loss of 10 percent
or more in an earthquake of limited intensity. This Bulletin presents the
Department‚Äôs interpretation of a 10-percent capacity loss based on visual
indicators of such damage and provides evaluation and retrofit scope for
buildings with such earthquake induced disproportionate damage.
Residential buildings that incur substantial structural damage or
disproportionate damage as detailed in this Bulletin are considered to be
‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù per California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3 (b)
Structural hazards and (o) Inadequate structural resistance to horizontal
forces.
APPLICABILITY
A building is eligible to apply the interpretations and provisions of this
Bulletin if all of the following criteria are met:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†The building has at least one story in which the seismic force-
resisting system is a wood light-frame system in at least one direction, and
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†The building has only wood floor and wood roof diaphragms, and
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†The building has a continuous foundation, and
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†The building contains a residential occupancy group R-1, R-2, R-3.1, or
R-4 as defined in San Francisco Building Code Section 310. At the discretion of
the Department of Inspection, a building in occupancy group R-3 with one or two
residential units may be deemed eligible if it is structurally and
architecturally similar to the typical residential buildings with three or more
units addressed in this Bulletin.
Buildings of other construction types and occupancies may also apply the
provisions of this Bulletin on a case-by-case basis when approved by the
Department of Building Inspection. Other methods of determining capacity loss
based on analysis, testing, or other objective data may be allowed at the
discretion of the Department.
Qualified historic buildings are permitted to be evaluated or retrofitted using
the provisions in the California Historical Building Code, provided that such
standards do not result in seismic performance less than the evaluation and
retrofit engineering criteria detailed in this Bulletin.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES
For the purpose of determining if a building has incurred substantial
structural or disproportionate damage, visual observation and classification of
damage patterns may be used in lieu of a calculation of percentage loss of
capacity. All determinations of substantial structural or disproportionate
damage, including visual observation and classification of damage, shall be
made by a licensed design professional and shall be submitted in accordance
with San Francisco Existing Building Code Section 405.2.3.1. For damage not
deemed to be either substantial structural damage or disproportionate damage,
repairs shall restore the building to its permitted pre-earthquake condition by
methods acceptable to the Department.
Buildings with Substantial Structural Damage
Substantial structural damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-
resisting system shall be deemed to exist when a ‚Äútriggering damage pattern‚Äù is
observed in any system or components listed in Table 1. Table 1 also includes
earthquake-induced substantial structural damage indicators for gravity load-
carrying components. These are defined in San Francisco Existing Building Code,
Section
202 as ‚Äúany component, or any group of such components, that supports more than
30 percent of the total area of the structure‚Äôs floor(s) and roof(s),‚Äù and the
remaining capacity of any damaged components, ‚Äúwith respect to all dead and
live loads, is less than 75 percent of that required by this code for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose and location.‚Äù Per San Francisco
Existing Building Code, Section 502.2, the provisions of this Bulletin apply to
substantial structural damage to gravity load-carrying components only when
that damage has been caused by earthquake.
Buildings with Disproportionate Damage
Disproportionate damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting
system shall be deemed to exist when any of the earthquake ‚Äútriggering damage
patterns‚Äù is observed in any system or component listed in Table 1. Table 1
also includes disproportionate damage indicators for gravity load-carrying
systems, which include any component, or any group of components, that supports
more than 10 percent of the total area of a structure‚Äôs floor(s) and roof(s),
and in which the remaining capacity of any damaged components, with respect to
all dead and live loads, is less than 75 percent of that required by this code
for new buildings of similar structure, purpose and location. The provisions of
this Bulletin apply to disproportionate damage to gravity load-carrying
components only when such damage has been caused by earthquake, as SFEBC
Section 405.2.2 notes that a building with disproportionate damage is subject
to the provisions and requirements for substantial structural damage.

Further Evaluation and Retrofit Scope for Buildings with Substantial Structural
Damage
For buildings with substantial structural damage, further evaluation and
retrofit shall proceed in accordance with San Francisco Existing Building Code
Section 405.2.3.1 subject to the following guidelines:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Evaluation and retrofit shall consider the entire structure, including
all stories and all directions, regardless of where in the structure the
triggering damage occurred, except that for certain building types and damage
patterns, partial retrofit may be permitted under one of the alternative
criteria documents given in the ‚ÄúEvaluation and Retrofit Engineering Criteria‚Äù
section of this Bulletin.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Gravity load-carrying components need not be considered for evaluation
and retrofit except when they are also part of the building‚Äôs seismic force-
resisting system or are subject to San Francisco Existing Building Code Section
502.2.
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Nonstructural components need not be considered for evaluation or
retrofit unless subject to separate building code requirements, ordinances, or
regulations.
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†Load combinations that include wind or earthquake effects shall be
considered.
Further Evaluation and Retrofit Scope for Buildings with Disproportionate
Damage
For buildings with disproportionate damage, further evaluation and retrofit
shall proceed in accordance with San Francisco Existing Building Code Section
405.2.2 subject to the following guidelines:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Evaluation and retrofit shall consider the entire structure, including
all stories and all directions, regardless of where in the structure the
triggering damage occurred, except that for certain building types and damage
patterns, partial retrofit may be permitted under one of the alternative
criteria documents given in the ‚ÄúEvaluation and Retrofit Engineering Criteria‚Äù
section of this Bulletin.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Exception: When the disproportionate damage is limited to connections or
load path elements and does not affect wood-frame wall segments, piers, or
other vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, the evaluation
and retrofit scope may be limited to components throughout the building in
directions similar to or performing the same function as the components with
damage.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Gravity load-carrying components need not be considered for evaluation
and retrofit except when they are also part of the building‚Äôs seismic force-
resisting system or are subjected to San Francisco Existing Building Code

retrofit unless subject to separate building code requirements, ordinances, or
regulations.
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†Load combinations that include earthquake effects shall be considered.
Load combinations that include wind effects may be ignored.
EVALUATION AND RETROFIT ENGINEERING CRITERIA
If, after evaluation, the pre-earthquake building is determined to satisfy the
criteria of San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section 405.2.3, then the
building need not be retrofitted, but shall be restored to its pre-earthquake
capacity. When retrofit is triggered by earthquake damage at any level, the
engineering criteria for retrofit shall be permitted to use earthquake loads
that are 75 percent of those prescribed by the San Francisco Building Code for
new construction, in accordance with SFEBC Section 405.2.3.
Alternatively, any of the following codes, standards, or guidelines may be used
as alternative evaluation or retrofit criteria for qualifying buildings:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Meets ASCE 31-03 for the Life Safety Performance Level, or
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Meets ASCE 41-06 for the Life Safety Performance Level (S-3) in a BSE-
1 earthquake hazard level, or
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†If the triggering damage involves only a soft, weak, or open front
first story, meets CEBC Appendix A -
Chapter A4 or IEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4 with NCSEA/SEAOC amendments, or
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†Meets San Francisco Existing Building Code Section

               San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section 405.2.3 triggers seismic
               evaluation, and possibly retrofit, of buildings when earthquake-related damage
               reaches the level of ‚Äúsubstantial structural damage to vertical elements of the
               lateral-force-resisting system.‚Äù Substantial structural damage is defined in
               Section
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬202 as, in essence, a loss of lateral capacity of 20 percent or more in any
               horizontal direction. The code gives no specific rules for identifying a 20-
               percent loss or guidance as to how to calculate capacity loss, so implementation
               of these code provisions relies on interpretation by the Department of Building
               Inspection. This Bulletin presents the Department‚Äôs interpretation of a 20-
               percent lateral capacity loss for concrete buildings constructed before May 21,
               1973.
In addition to substantial structural damage, San Francisco Existing Building
Code, Section 405.2 triggers seismic evaluation, and possibly retrofit, when
earthquake-related damage reaches the level of disproportionate damage, defined
in Section
202 as, in essence, a lateral capacity loss of 10 percent or more in an
earthquake of limited intensity. This Bulletin presents the Department‚Äôs
interpretation of a 10-percent capacity loss for concrete buildings constructed
before May 21, 1973.
For concrete shear wall and infill buildings, the evaluation procedures
developed in FEMA 306 and the simplified version of the methodology in FEMA 308
are used determine whether a building with substantial structural damage or
disproportionate damage needs to be restored to its pre-earthquake capacity or
retrofitted. Substantial structural damage or disproportionate damage may also
be deemed to exist when damage to specific building components or conditions
reaches the severity of ‚Äúearthquake triggering damage‚Äù based on visual
observation and classification.
For concrete moment-frame buildings, repair and retrofit requirements are based
only on visual observation and classification of specific components damage.
Residential buildings that incur substantial structural damage or
disproportionate damage as detailed in this Bulletin are considered to be
‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù per California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3(b)
Structural hazards and (o) Inadequate structural resistance to horizontal
forces.
APPLICABILITY:
A building is eligible to apply the interpretations and provisions of this
Bulletin if all of the following criteria are met:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†The building has cast-in-place concrete bearing walls or cast-in-place
concrete frames, and
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†The building has at least one floor diaphragm constructed with cast-in-
place concrete.
Buildings of other construction types may also apply the provisions of this
Bulletin on a case-by-case basis when approved by the Department of Building
Inspection. Other methods of determining capacity loss based on analysis,
testing, or other objective data may also be allowed at the discretion of the
Department.
Qualified buildings may be permitted to be evaluated or retrofitted using the
provisions in the California Historical Building Code, provided that such
standards do not result in seismic performance less than the evaluation and
retrofit engineering criteria detailed in this Bulletin.
DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this bulletin, the following definitions shall apply:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†CONCRETE SHEAR WALL: A concrete wall which resists lateral forces
applied parallel to the plane of the wall.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†CONCRETE MOMENT FRAME: A building frame system in which seismic shear
forces are resisted by shear and flexure in members and joints of the frame,
including slab-column moment frames.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†CONCRETE INFILL FRAME: A concrete moment frame having panel(s) of
masonry that participate in resisting lateral forces that are placed within the
frame members.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†NONSTRUCTURAL REPAIR: Repairs that improve the visual appearance of
damage to a component. These repairs may also restore the nonstructural
properties of a component, such as weather protection. Any structural benefit
is negligible. This is defined as ‚ÄúCosmetic Repair‚Äù in FEMA 308.
EVALUATION PROCEDURE AND RETROFIT SCOPE
Concrete Shear Wall and Infill Frame Buildings
General
Substantial structural damage to elements of the lateral force-resisting system
shall be deemed to exist when the results of a FEMA 306 evaluation shows that
capacity loss exceeds 20% for a concrete shear wall or infill frame building,
or when any of the ‚Äútriggering damage‚Äù criteria for substantial structural
damage described in Table 1 is observed in an eligible building.
Additionally, disproportionate damage shall be deemed to exist when a FEMA 306
evaluation shows a capacity loss exceeding 10%, or when any of the ‚Äútriggering
damage‚Äù for disproportionate damage described in Table 1 is observed in an
eligible building.
Overview
The flowchart in Figure 1 shall be followed to determine the post-earthquake
damage repair or retrofit requirements related to substantial structural damage
to concrete shear wall and infill frame buildings.
The process begins with a determination of whether the damaged building has
sufficient pre-earthquake capacity to satisfy San Francisco Existing Building
Code, Section
304.4, which references the May 21, 1973 milestone requirements of San
Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
304.4. If the building in its pre-damaged state satisfies this code provision,
then the building need not be retrofitted regardless of the level of damage,
and restoration to pre-earthquake capacity is sufficient. Alternatively, if a
full FEMA 306 evaluation (labeled as ‚ÄúOptional FEMA 306 Evaluation‚Äù in Figure
1) shows a capacity loss of less than 5 percent, nonstructural repair to the
building instead of restoration to pre-earthquake capacity shall be permitted,
except that individual component damage or condition repair per Table 1 is also
required.
If the building does not meet the San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
304.4 requirements per San Francisco Existing Building Code Section
304.4, then a full FEMA 306 evaluation (labeled as ‚ÄúMandatory FEMA 306
Evaluation‚Äù in Figure 1) is required, and nonstructural repair, restoration to
pre-earthquake capacity, or retrofit requirements may be triggered as shown in
Figure 1. In addition, individual component damage or condition repair per
Table 1 is required.

FEMA 306 Evaluation Process
A FEMA 306 evaluation process for the pre-event structure and the damaged
structure shall be performed using the guidelines below:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†The evaluation shall use the nonlinear static procedures defined in
FEMA 306 to determine the capacity for pre-event and damaged conditions. FEMA
306 was developed at the time FEMA 273 was also in development, prior to the
publication of FEMA 356. Since then, additional research and development effort
was incorporated into FEMA 356 and later into ASCE 41. Therefore, the
comparable, more current equations in ASCE 41 shall be used in performing a
FEMA 306 evaluation rather than the FEMA 273 equivalents.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†The global displacement demand shall be determined in accordance with
ASCE 41.
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†The performance objective shall meet the requirements of ASCE 41 for
Life Safety Structural Performance Level (S-3) at 75% of the spectral demand
associated with the current code value at the building site.
Simplified FEMA 308 Evaluation Process
The following simplified version of the FEMA 308 approach, based on loss in
performance, L, may be used for the purpose of determining threshold triggers
for restoration to pre-earthquake capacity and retrofit. The process is similar
to that outlined in Figure 1. The FEMA 308 parameters shall be determined using
the guidelines as follows. For further definition of the FEMA 308 parameters
needed for the evaluation.
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†To use this method, first determine the following performance capacity
and loss indices:
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Pre-event (Undamaged) Performance Index:
¬†¬†¬†P = dc / dd,
where dc is the global displacement capacity for the selected performance
objective and dd is the maximum global displacement demand for the selected
ground motion. This performance index is calculated using component properties
for the pre-event conditions in accordance with the methodology outlined in
FEMA 306.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Damaged Performance Index:
¬†¬†¬†P‚Äô = d‚Äôc / d‚Äôd,
where the prime symbol (‚Äô) denotes that the global displacement capacity and
demand, d‚Äôc and d‚Äôd, respectively, are determined for the components in their
damaged state using FEMA 306.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Loss:
¬†¬†¬†L = 1 ‚Äì (P‚Äô / P),
where L is the performance loss of a building due to earthquake damage, and is
given by the ratio of the damaged performance index, P‚Äô, to the undamaged
performance index, P, for a specific performance objective. L ranges between 0
and 1.
3.¬†¬†¬†To determine whether earthquake damage is acceptable and neither
restoration to pre-earthquake capacity nor retrofit is triggered, the
performance loss, L, is compared against the FEMA 308 Table 3-1 threshold
parameters defined below:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Lr(min): The Loss threshold below which neither restoration to pre-
earthquake capacity nor retrofit is triggered, shall be defined as follows:
¬†¬†¬†Lr(min)¬†= 0.05 for earthquake event with Sa0.3¬†‚â§ 0.4g
¬†¬†¬†Lr(min)¬†= 0.05 for earthquake event with Sa0.3 > 0.4g
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Lr(max): The Loss threshold above which either restoration to pre-
earthquake capacity or retrofit is triggered. For this simplified procedure, Lr
(max) may be taken to be the same as Lr(min) since Lr does not vary:
¬†¬†¬†Lr(max)¬†= 0.05 for earthquake event with Sa0.3¬†‚â§ 0.4g
¬†¬†¬†Lr(max)¬†= 0.05 for earthquake event with Sa0.3 > 0.4g
Alternatively, the Damaged Performance Index, P‚Äô may be used to determine
whether earthquake damage is acceptable and neither restoration to pre-
earthquake capacity nor retrofit is triggered by comparing P‚Äô against the FEMA
308 Table 3-1 limit parameters defined below:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†P‚Äômin: The Damage Performance Index limit below which restoration to pre-
earthquake capacity or retrofit is triggered, is not used since Lr does not
vary for the simplified method.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†P‚Äômax: The Damage Performance Index limit above which neither restoration
to pre-earthquake capacity nor retrofit is triggered regardless of the value of
Loss, L, shall be defined as 1.0.
4.¬†¬†¬†If a building is required to be restored to its pre-earthquake capacity or
retrofitted per step 2, the Performance Loss, L, is compared against the FEMA
308 Table 3-2 threshold parameters defined below to determine if retrofit is
triggered:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Lu(min): The Loss threshold below which earthquake damage does not trigger
retrofit but requires restoration to pre-earthquake capacity, shall be defined
as below:
¬†¬†¬†Lu(min)¬†= 0.10 for earthquake event with Sa0.3¬†‚â§ 0.4g
¬†¬†¬†Lu(min)¬†= 0.20 for earthquake event with Sa0.3 > 0.4g
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Lu(max): The Loss threshold above which earthquake damage triggers
retrofit, shall be taken to be the same as Lu(min) since Lu does not vary for
the simplified method:
¬†¬†¬†Lu(max)¬†= 0.10 for earthquake with Sa0.3¬†‚â§ 0.4g
¬†¬†¬†Lu(max)¬†= 0.20 for earthquake with Sa0.3 > 0.4g
Alternatively, the Undamaged Performance Index, P may be used to determine
whether restoration to pre-earthquake capacity or retrofit is triggered by
comparing P against the FEMA 308 Table 3-2 limit parameters defined below:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Pmin: The Pre-event Performance Index limit below which existing earthquake
damage triggers retrofit, is not used since Lu does not vary for the purpose of
the simplified method.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Pmax: The Pre-event Performance Index limit above which existing earthquake
damage does not trigger retrofit and restoration to pre-earthquake capacity is
sufficient regardless of the value of Loss, L, shall be taken as 1.0.
Retrofit Triggers due to Specific Component Damage or Conditions
In addition to the retrofit triggers per the FEMA 306 and 308 methodologies
described above, damage to any of the specific components or other conditions
noted in Table 1 below shall trigger retrofit shown in the ‚ÄúAction Required‚Äù
column of the table if damage is observed to reach the severity of ‚Äútriggering
damage.‚Äù The conditions noted in Table 1 are primarily related to gravity-load-
carrying component damage, load path failures, or significant damage in
individual components. For damage less than the ‚Äútriggering damage,‚Äù repairs
shall be made to return the building to original strength or condition by
methods acceptable to the Department of Building Inspection.

Concrete Moment-Frame Buildings
The process for determining whether repair or retrofit is triggered for a
concrete moment-frame building begins with a determination of whether the
damaged building has adequate pre-earthquake capacity to comply with San
Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
304.4. If this is satisfied, then the building need not be retrofitted
regardless of the level of damage, and restoration of the building to its pre-
earthquake capacity shall be undertaken. Unlike concrete shear-wall and infill
buildings, nonstructural repairs shall not be permitted even if a full FEMA 306
evaluation has determined that the capacity loss is below 5 percent. For non-
complying buildings, if any of the component damage or conditions given in
Table 1 is present, the building shall be retrofitted as required by Table 1.
For concrete frame buildings with any interacting walls, in addition to the
Table 1 checks, the evaluation procedure and retrofit scope given above for
concrete shear wall and infill frame buildings shall be applied. When a FEMA
306 analysis is used to determine loss of capacity outlined in this bulletin
for concrete shear wall and infill frame buildings, the moment-frame capacity
may not be included in development of the force-displacement pushover curve.
EVALUATION AND RETROFIT ENGINEERING CRITERIA
When retrofit is triggered by earthquake damage at any level, the engineering
criteria for retrofit shall be permitted to use earthquake loads that are 75
percent of those prescribed by the San Francisco Building Code for new
construction, in accordance with SFEBC Section 405.2.3.
In addition, any of the following alternative codes, standards, or guidelines
may be used as alternative evaluation or retrofit criteria for qualifying
buildings:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of ASCE 31-03 for the Life Safety Performance
Level, or
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of ASCE 41-06 for the Life Safety Performance
Level (S-3) in the BSE-1 earthquake hazard level, or
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of San Francisco Existing Building Code
304.4.

               The purpose of this Bulletin is to establish policy for interpreting the San
               Francisco Building Code regarding post-earthquake damage retrofit triggers for
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: one- and two-family dwellings of wood-frame construction and to detail the scope
               and criteria for such triggered retrofits. The Bulletin also provides guidance
               on the scope of required building repair if retrofits are not triggered.

               Damage in Residential Woodframe Buildings
               FEMA 306: Evaluation of Earthquake Damaged Concrete and Masonry Wall Buildings:
               Basic Procedures Manual
               San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section 405.2.3 triggers seismic
               evaluation, and possibly retrofit of buildings, when earthquake-related damage
               reaches the level of ‚Äúsubstantial structural damage to vertical elements of the
               lateral-force-resisting system.‚Äù Substantial structural damage is defined in San
               Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
               202 as, in essence, a loss of lateral capacity of 20 percent or more in any
               horizontal direction. The code does not give specific rules for identifying a
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬20-percent capacity loss nor guidance as to how to calculate capacity loss, so
               implementation of these code provisions relies on interpretation by the
               Department of Building Inspection. This Bulletin presents the Department‚Äôs
               interpretation of a 20-percent lateral capacity loss based on visual indicators
               of such damage, and details the evaluation procedure and retrofit scope for
               buildings that exhibit earthquake-induced substantial structural damage. The
               Bulletin also provides guidance on the scope of required repair of building
               components or assemblies if such retrofits are not triggered.
¬†
In addition to substantial structural damage, San Francisco Existing Building
Code, Section 405.2.2 triggers structural evaluation and possibly retrofit when
earthquake-related damage reaches the level of disproportionate damage, which
is defined in San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
202 as, in essence, a lateral capacity loss of 10 percent or more in an
earthquake of limited intensity. This Bulletin presents the Department of
Building Inspection‚Äôs interpretation of a 10 percent capacity loss based on
visual indicators of such damage and provides evaluation procedures and
retrofit scope for buildings with such earthquake induced disproportionate
damage.
Residential buildings that incur substantial structural damage or
disproportionate damage as detailed in this Bulletin are considered to be
‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù per California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3(b)
Structural hazards and (o) Inadequate structural resistance to horizontal
forces.
APPLICABILITY
A building is eligible to apply the interpretations and provisions of this
Bulletin if all of the following criteria are met:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†The building includes at least one story in which the seismic force-
resisting system consists of a wood light-frame system in at least one
direction, and
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†The building has only wood floor and roof diaphragms, and
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†The building contains a residential occupancy group R-3 as defined in
San Francisco Building Code, Section 310. At the discretion of the Department
of Building Inspection, a building in this group may be evaluated and repaired
or retrofitted using the criteria for a residential building with three or more
units under
AB-098 if the building is structurally and architecturally similar to that
group of buildings.
Buildings of other construction types and occupancies may also apply the
provisions of this Bulletin on a case-by-case basis when approved by the
Department of Building Inspection. Other methods of determining capacity loss
based on analysis, testing, or other objective data may also be allowed at the
discretion of the Department.
Qualified buildings may be permitted to be evaluated or retrofitted using the
provisions in the California Historical Building Code provided that such
provisions do not result in seismic performance that is less than the
evaluation and retrofit engineering provisions detailed in this Bulletin.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND RETROFIT SCOPE
For the purpose of determining if a building has incurred substantial
structural damage or disproportionate damage per San Francisco Building Code,
visual observation and classification of damage and severity may be used in
lieu of a calculation of percentage loss of capacity. All determinations of
substantial structural damage or disproportionate damage, including visual
observation and classification of damage and severity, shall be made by a
licensed design professional, and evaluation shall be submitted in accordance
with San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section 405.2.3.1. For damage not
deemed to be either substantial structural damage or disproportionate damage,
repairs shall restore the building to its original strength or condition by
methods acceptable to the Department of Building Inspection.
Buildings with Substantial Structural Damage
Earthquake-induced substantial structural damage to elements of lateral force-
resisting system of a building shall be deemed to exist when any of the
components and conditions is observed to reach the severity of ‚Äútriggering
damage‚Äù given in Table 1. For buildings with such substantial structural
damage, evaluation and retrofit, where required, shall proceed in accordance
with the ‚ÄúAction Required‚Äù column shown in Table 1 and the ‚ÄúFurther Evaluation
and Retrofit Engineering Criteria‚Äù section.
Buildings with Disproportionate Damage
Disproportionate damage to elements of the lateral force-resisting system of a
building shall be deemed to exist when any of the components and conditions is
observed to reach the severity of ‚Äútriggering damage‚Äù given in Table 1. For
buildings with such disproportionate damage, evaluation and retrofit, where
required, shall proceed in accordance with the ‚ÄúAction Required‚Äù column shown
in Table 1 and the ‚ÄúFurther Evaluation and Retrofit Engineering Criteria‚Äù
section.

FURTHER EVALUATION AND RETROFIT ENGINEERING CRITERIA:
If, after an evaluation per San Francisco Existing Building Code, Section
405.2.3, the pre-earthquake building is determined to satisfy the criteria,
then the building need not be retrofitted, but shall be restored to its pre-
earthquake capacity. When retrofit is triggered by earthquake damage at any
level, the engineering criteria for retrofit shall be permitted to use
earthquake loads that are 75 percent of those prescribed by the San Francisco
Building Code for new construction, in accordance with San Francisco Existing
Building Code, Section 405.2.3.
Alternatively, any of the following codes, standards, or guidelines may be used
as alternative evaluation or retrofit criteria for qualifying buildings:
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of ASCE 31-03 for the Life Safety Performance
Level, or
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of ASCE 41-06 for the Life Safety Performance
Level (S-3) in a BSE-1 earthquake hazard level, or
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Meets the requirements of CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4 or IEBC Appendix
A - Chapter A4 with NCSEA/SEAOC amendments, or
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†Meets the San Francisco Existing Building Code, Sections 315, 320.

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Voluntary Sprinkler Protection for Existing High-Rise Buildings
               The purpose of this Administrative Bulletin is to outline the procedure for
               documenting voluntary sprinkler protection of select high-rise buildings in DBI‚Äôs
               Permit Tracking System. It applies to existing high-rise buildings that (1) were
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: built before State law required sprinkler protection in high-rise buildings (July
               1, 1974) and (2) were excluded from San Francisco‚Äôs high-rise sprinkler retrofit
               ordinance (Ord. 377-93) and not required to comply with California Fire Code
               1103.5.4.

               ¬†¬†¬†- Section 903.2.15, Automatic sprinkler system‚Äìexisting high-rise buildings
               San Francisco has many high-rise buildings that were built before the State
               required sprinkler protection in high-rise buildings. The City and County of San
               Francisco passed a high-rise sprinkler retrofit ordinance in 1993 (#377-93) to
               address this situation. This ordinance was codified in SFEBC Section
               314.27. Basically, the ordinance required complete sprinkler protection in high-
               rise commercial buildings and tourist hotels built before the State law took
               effect. It also created a number of technical requirements specifically for high-
               rise buildings covered by the ordinance. It did not apply to pre-1974 high-rise
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬residential buildings where occupants are primarily permanent in nature (currently
               classified as R-2 occupancies but classified as R-1 prior to 2008), mixed-use
               occupancies containing an R-1 or R-2 occupancy, or historic buildings. This
               Administrative Bulletin is intended to provide a mechanism for pre-1974 high-rise
               buildings to be recorded as fully sprinklered in DBI‚Äôs Permit Tracking System when
               they are voluntarily sprinklered throughout. It is similar to the process required
               for high-rise buildings covered by the ordinance but it is voluntary and more
               streamlined and culminates with an approved Administrative Permit rather than an
               approved ‚ÄúUmbrella Permit.‚Äù
¬†
The following criteria and procedures shall be followed to obtain an
Administrative Permit for complete sprinkler protection of pre-1974 high-rise
buildings exempted from the high-rise sprinkler ordinance.
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Sprinkler Criteria
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Schedule a pre-application meeting with SFFD to resolve applicable
San Francisco requirements for the subject building. For example, the San
Francisco Fire Code requires new high-rise buildings to have two fire pumps and
two on-site water supplies for buildings over 200 feet high, fire department
connections on each side of the building facing a street, and two risers per
zone. These requirements may or may not be applicable, on a case-by-case basis,
for existing pre-1974 high-rise buildings not covered by the ordinance.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†For buildings that do not have any sprinkler protection, the new
sprinkler system shall be designed and installed in accordance with the
applicable edition of NFPA 13 in effect when the sprinkler permit application
is submitted.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†For buildings that are partially sprinklered, the existing sprinkler
systems can remain as-is provided (a) the existing sprinkler systems have been
maintained, (b) they are zoned on a per floor basis, and (c) the applicable
sprinkler permits can be located in DBI‚Äôs files. If any of these provisions are
not met, the appropriate resolution shall be determined through a pre-
application meeting with DBI and SFFD. If any portion of the building is not
sprinklered, the new sprinkler system shall be designed and installed in
accordance with the applicable edition of NFPA 13 in effect when the sprinkler
permit application is submitted.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†For buildings that are believed to be fully sprinklered, proceed to
sprinkler special inspection.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Sprinkler Special Inspection
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†The building owner/manager shall engage a fire protection engineer
to perform a sprinkler special inspection of the building and prepare a
Sprinkler Special Inspection Report. The fire protection engineer shall be
licensed in the State of California.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†The sprinkler special inspector shall review DBI‚Äôs files to identify
previous sprinkler permits for the subject building.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†The sprinkler special inspector shall walk the entire building to
verify complete coverage.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†If the building does not have sprinklers in some areas, these
deficiencies shall be transmitted to the building owner/manager and corrected
by a licensed sprinkler contractor before the Administrative Permit application
and Sprinkler Special Inspection Report are submitted for review and approval.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†If the building does not comply with applicable requirements from
the San Francisco Fire Code as determined by the pre-application meeting with
SFFD (See A.1 above), these deficiencies shall be transmitted to the building
owner/manager and corrected by a licensed sprinkler contractor before the
Administrative Permit application and Sprinkler Special Inspection Report are
submitted for review and approval.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†For buildings that are completely sprinklered and comply with
applicable San Francisco requirements, proceed to Sprinkler Special Inspection
Report.
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Sprinkler Special Inspection Report
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†The sprinkler special inspector shall prepare a Sprinkler Special
Inspection Report to be submitted with the Administrative Permit application.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†The Sprinkler Special Inspection Report shall include the block and
lot numbers, a brief description of the building, a table listing all sprinkler
permits for the building including the sprinkler permit for correcting observed
deficiencies, if any, and a statement that the building is fully sprinklered.
If any sprinkler permits are still open, they must be closed before the
Sprinkler Special Inspection Report is submitted for review and approval.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†The report must be signed and stamped by the sprinkler special
inspector.
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†Administrative Permit Application
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†A standard building permit application and two copies of the
Sprinkler Special Inspection Report shall be presented to Initial Permit Review
(IPR). The submitter shall clearly state on the form that it is an
Administrative Permit to document complete sprinkler protection. There is no
construction so the value of construction on the form is $1.00.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†After receiving a permit application number, the submitter shall
hand-carry the permit application and Sprinkler Special Inspection Reports to
DBI and SFFD stations for approval signatures.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†After receiving all approval signatures and paying all permit fees,
a Job Card and approved permit including a copy of the approved Sprinkler
Special Inspection Report will be issued.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Inspection requests shall be made and final signatures obtained on
the Job Card from the SFFD and subsequently from the DBI Building Inspector.
¬†¬†¬†Whenever future renovations are made to an existing high-rise building which
has an Administrative Permit confirming complete sprinkler protection, the
approved Administrative Permit application number shall be clearly indicated on
the permit application for renovations.

               The Mandatory Seismic Retrofit Program for Wood-Frame Buildings was established
               to support the City‚Äôs post-earthquake resilience goals. Compliance with these
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬code requirements is intended to improve building performance by reducing the
               risk of collapse and increasing the likelihood that an upgraded building will
               continue to be habitable or repairable. Compliance does not establish any
               certainty of performance or specific level of building performance.
¬†
This bulletin provides information about procedures for administration of the
Mandatory Seismic Retrofit Program for Wood-Frame Buildings. Detailed technical
criteria and related information regarding this upgrade program for wood-frame
buildings may be found in Administrative Bulletin
AB-107, Application of Engineering Criteria in SFEBC
Chapter 5E.
The requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E and the related design criteria represent a minimum standard to
reduce earthquake risk. Property owners may undertake seismic retrofit
improvements that exceed the requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E.
IMPLEMENTATION:
Screening Form
On September 15, 2013, the Department will mail a Notice and Screening Form to
all owners of buildings that are within the scope of SFEBC
Chapter 5E. The Screening Form provides a simplified mechanism to determine if
buildings must comply with the seismic upgrade requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E, and to identify the time frame for building retrofit within a four-
tier system. All Screening Forms must be returned to the Department no later
than September 15, 2014. Information provided on the Screening Form will be
spot-checked by DBI staff; if errors are found or if additional information is
required, the Department will contact the property owner or the owner‚Äôs
designated representative.
Copies of the Screening Form and detailed instructions for completion and
submittal of this form are available from the Department‚Äôs website at
www.sfdbi.org/softstory or at the Department offices at 49 South Van Ness
Avenue, San Francisco. There is no fee for submittal of the Screening Form.
Optional Evaluation Form
A building that has been previously seismically upgraded or which the owner
believes may already meet the requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E  may be exempt from this program if an evaluation confirms that the
criteria detailed in SFEBC
Chapter 5E  are met. This confirmation may be done using the Optional
Evaluation Form process. These forms and detailed instructions for completion
and submittal of the form are available on the Department‚Äôs website at
www.sfdbi.org/softstory or at the Department offices at 49 South Van Ness
Avenue, San Francisco. A fee for a minimum of two hours of plan review time is
due upon submittal of the Optional Evaluation Form. Additional fees may apply
if more than two hours is required for plan review.
Plan review by Department of Building Inspection
Building permit applications that are submitted to comply with this program
will be reviewed for compliance with acceptable methodologies and appropriate
design criteria. Insofar as possible, such review will be done over-the-
counter. If over-the-counter review is not an available option, permit
applications must be submitted. Such applications will be routed and tracked in
accordance with standard Department procedures.
Plan review by other agencies
Review by agencies other than the Department of Building Inspection shall be in
accordance with the guidelines set forth by the corresponding department .
Where such guidelines do not cover specific issues or concerns, such other
agencies will apply their standard plan review guidelines.
Fees for plan review and permit issuance by all agencies shall be as detailed
in codes and regulations.
Specific conditions of approval may be part of permit approval by any City
agency. Project sponsors should carefully review all comments and notes on
plans and permits regarding such conditions of approval.
Triggered code requirements
In accordance with the specific requirements of the San Francisco Building
Code, smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors may be required to be
installed in a building at the time of this seismic upgrade work. Other work,
such as water heater bracing, may also be triggered. Please review the codes
and plan review comments for more information about such triggered such work.
In accordance with San Francisco Building Code
Chapter 11B, Accessibility to Public Buildings, Public Accommodations,
Commercial Buildings and Public Housing, disability access improvements will be
required when seismic upgrade work involves alterations and/or structural
repairs.
Chapter 11A, Housing Accessibility, may apply in certain unusual cases when a
building has undergone a change of use, addition, or provides certain public or
common use areas. A design professional or consultant will be able to provide
guidance as to the scope of any such required disability access work.
Modifications, Equivalencies, or Alternates
Any proposal for seismic retrofit work that does not meet the specific
technical requirements or the performance criteria detailed in SFEBC
Chapter 5E , in Administrative Bulletin
AB-107, or in this administrative bulletin may be considered for administrative
approval by the Department of Building Inspection on a case-by-case basis if
the requirements of San Francisco Building Code, Section
104A.2.8, Alternate Materials, Design, and Methods of Construction, are met.
Such equivalencies or alternatives must be shown to be at least equal to the
code requirements and criteria for structural integrity, suitability, strength,
effectiveness, durability and safety. Applications for modifications,
equivalencies, or alternates should be submitted in accordance with the
requirements of Administrative Bulletin
AB-005, Procedures for Approval of Local Equivalencies.
Inspection and Special Inspection
Work undertaken to comply with SFEBC Chapter 5E must meet all requirements of
the San Francisco Building Code including inspections and, when necessary,
Special Inspections. Please review approved permits and permit documents
regarding any such special inspection requirements.
Completion of Work
Completion of this required seismic upgrade work will result in the issuance of
a Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). This CFC will be issued only following
final inspection, submittal and approval of any Special Inspection documents,
and compliance with all conditions of approval. The CFC document will become
part of the permanent record of the building.
Extensions of time to complete work may be granted in accordance with SFBC
Section
106A4.4, but such extensions may not extend the time beyond the deadline
designated in SFEBC Table 5E-A for completion of required work.
Historic Buildings
Buildings that qualify to use the California Historical Building Code may apply
the provisions and analysis techniques referenced in the California Historical
Building Code, Chapter 8-7, Structural Regulations, and Chapter 8-8, Archaic
Materials and Methods of Construction, and other provisions of that code upon
approval of the Department.
To determine if a building can be qualified to use the California Historical
Building Code, please contact the Technical Services Division of the Department
of Building Inspection at techq@sfgov.org.
Optional Earthquake Recording Instrumentation
Building owners are encouraged to provide earthquake recording instrumentation
in their buildings. This instrumentation will typically require installation of
sensors at the ground level, on the second floor, and at the highest story of a
building. Costs of providing instrumentation are modest. The Department may
assist in installation and maintenance of earthquake recording instruments in
accordance with San Francisco Building Code, Section 1604.11.
Earthquake recording instrumentation provides information about actual building
movement. Instrumentation may be valuable to a building owner in providing a
clearer understanding of actual building performance in an earthquake, possibly
reducing the need for more detailed post-earthquake inspection and evaluation.
The information from instrumented buildings will also provide scientists and
engineers with a better understanding of the earthquake behavior of buildings.
For information about participation in the optional earthquake recording
instrumentation program, please contact the Technical Services Division at
techq@sfgov.org.
ENFORCEMENT AND ABATEMENT
Enforcement and abatement action will be promptly taken by the Department if a
property owner fails to comply with any of the requirements of this program,
including failure to submit a properly competed Screening Form or other
document within the allowable one-year time, submittal of Screening Form or
other documents that are found to contain errors or misrepresentations, failure
to obtain a building permit or failure to complete all work and obtain a final
inspection within the time limits indicated in SFEBC Table 5E-A, or for any
other violation of this code. Such enforcement and abatement action will be in
accordance with the requirements of San Francisco Building Code, Section
102A, Unsafe Buildings, Structures or Property.
In every case, when any required action has not been properly completed within
the time limits of SFEBC
Chapter 5E, the Department will post the building with a notice stating:
¬†
Earthquake Warning:
This building is in violation of the requirements ofthe San Francisco Building
Code regarding earthquake safety.
¬†
This notice may not be removed until the building is in compliance with the
requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E. The notice shall also be recorded against the title of the
property, with a release of this notice filed upon compliance with the
requirements of SFEBC
Chapter 5E.
Violation of any code requirement related to the upgrade of these buildings may
subject the property owner to penalties detailed in San Francisco Building
Code, Section 103A, Violations, including fines of up to $500 per day per
violation and other penalties.
APPEALS
Board of Examiners
In cases where proposed modifications, equivalencies, or alternates
substantially differ from those prescribed in this bulletin, such proposals may
be referred by the Department to the Board of Examiners. Determinations made by
the Department regarding technical provisions may be appealed by the permit
applicant to the Board of Examiners in accordance with San Francisco Building
Code, Section
105A.
Building Inspection Commission
Any person may appeal a determination of the Director related to these
requirements to the Building Inspection Commission, pursuant to Chapter 77 of
the San Francisco Administrative Code.
RECORDING AND REPORTING
A list of buildings by street address and by block and lot number to which
notice has been given regarding this required seismic upgrade program will be
maintained and made public on the Department‚Äôs website.
The Department will track the status of all buildings noticed under this
program and will provide an annual update to the Mayor and the Board of
Supervisors regarding the status of compliance.

               Chapter 5E, created with Ordinance 66-13, mandates the seismic retrofit of
               certain wood-frame residential buildings. Section
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬506E.2 allows different criteria, or compliance alternatives. Section
               506E.4 calls for the development and publication of this Administrative Bulletin
               to ‚Äúdetail the technical requirements to be used for the evaluation and
               retrofitting of buildings required to meet the criteria established in Section
               506E.2.‚Äù
               This bulletin covers only SFEBC Sections
               506E.2 through
               506E.4.
               AB-106 covers administrative and procedural requirements of
               Chapter 5E. This Bulletin is separate from, but intended to be in coordination
SCOPE¬†¬†¬†:   with, other sections of
               Chapter 5E, other Administrative Bulletins, and other forms and instructions.
               Part A of this Bulletin applies to all projects seeking to comply with
               Chapter 5E, regardless of the compliance alternative. Parts B through G apply,
               respectively, to the specific compliance alternatives allowed in Section
               506E.2.
¬†
DEFINITIONS: In addition to the definitions in Section
503E, the following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Bulletin:
TARGET STORY. Any story above grade plane, or any basement or underfloor space
that extends above grade at any point, in which the wall layout or plan
configuration is substantially different from the wall layout or plan
configuration in the story above, except that a story is not a Target Story if
it is the topmost story or if the difference in configuration is primarily due
to the story above being a penthouse, an attic with a pitched roof, or a
setback story.
¬†
Commentary: This definition is taken from the Screening Form Instructions developed
to implement Section
506E.2, but it has been modified to clarify that the consideration of
‚Äúsubstantially different‚Äù wall layout or configuration applies to basements and
underfloor areas as well as to stories above grade plane. As discussed in the
Screening Form Instructions, ‚Äúsubstantially different from‚Äù generally means
‚Äúsubstantially weaker than‚Äù and can be a matter of engineering judgment, to be
decided as part of the Screening Form approval process. As described in the
Screening Form and Screening Form Instructions,
Chapter 5E applies only to wood-frame target stories, that is, target stories in
which the seismic force-resisting system in any direction relies on wood-frame wall
elements. A building can have more than one target story.
Part A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A1. Compliance
A1.1. Required scope of evaluation and/or retrofit. Evaluation and/or retrofit
shall address:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Vertical elements of the seismic force-resisting system (SFRS) in each
target story in which the existing SFRS relies on wood-frame elements, and
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Each floor diaphragm immediately above such a target story, and
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Elements of the seismic force-resisting load path from each such
diaphragm through the foundation.
Exception: Where the existing vertical elements of the SFRS are shown to comply
by evaluation, the diaphragm immediately above each target story need to be
evaluated.
A.1.1.1. Floor diaphragm evaluation and/or retrofit. Floor diaphragms subject
to evaluation and/or retrofit shall be shown to have adequate strength at the
following locations:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†For straight lumber sheathed diaphragms without integral hardwood
flooring: Throughout the diaphragm. At the discretion of the code official,
this requirement may be waived where the condition occurs only in relatively
small portions of each dwelling unit.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†For other diaphragms: At locations where forces are transferred between
the diaphragm and a new or strengthened vertical of the SFRS. Collector
elements may be provided to distribute the transferred force over a greater
force over a greater length of diaphragm.
¬†
Commentary: Evaluation of the diaphragm‚Äôs adequacy is only required when new
vertical elements are added to the target story or existing vertical elements
in the target story are strengthened. This allowance is considered appropriate
for the limited objective of
Chapter 5E. Therefore diaphragm adequacy need only be confirmed in two cases.
Case 1. Straight lumber sheathed diaphragms without integral hardwood flooring
are thought to be considerably weaker and more flexible than other diaphragm
systems. Though there are no known collapses due to this condition, expected
poor performance could compromise the building‚Äôs ability to meet even the
limited objective of
Chapter 5E. Integral hardwood flooring - but not newer ‚Äúfloating‚Äù wood flooring
- provides significant added strength and stiffness. Even in buildings with
original hardwood flooring, some remodeled, carpeted, or tiled areas might have
had the original wood flooring removed. Areas of the diaphragm that form a roof
for the target story (such as the portion of a garage that extends beyond the
wall line above, or at a lightwell or building setback) are also unlikely to
have hardwood flooring to supplement the straight sheathing. These areas should
be identified as part of the condition assessment (see Section A3) and
evaluated. Small isolated areas without hardwood flooring are not expected to
affect overall building performance, so the provision grants a waiver for these
cases. As a rule of thumb, an area up to 150 square feet per unit might
represent such an acceptable condition.
Case 2. Where vertical SFRS elements are added or strengthened, an adequate
load path and diaphragm must be provided. This provision requires a local check
for each such element but does not require an overall analysis of the full
diaphragm. The unit shear demand at each vertical element is calculated as the
force in the element divided by the length of the element plus any collector.
The shear demand is then compared to the unit shear capacity of the diaphragm.
Where demand is greater than capacity, either the diaphragm is strengthened or
the collector is lengthened. An existing diaphragm can be strengthened by
adding a wood structural panel soffit attached to the bottom of the floor
joists in the vicinity of the vertical SFRS element. The rules given in Section
B5.1.1.2 may be useful for combining the capacities of new and existing
diaphragm components. Diaphragm capacity need not be checked at existing
vertical elements that are not strengthened because (except for Case 1) it is
assumed that the unit capacities of the existing vertical elements and the
diaphragm are comparable.
A1.2. Other SFEBC requirements and Administrative Bulletins. Alterations and
repairs required to meet the provisions of
Chapter 5E shall comply with all other applicable structural requirements of
the SFEBC unless specifically waived by those requirements, by this Bulletin,
or by related Administrative Bulletins.
¬†
Commentary: See Administrative Bulletin 106 regarding procedural compliance
with SFEBC
Chapter 5E, specifically Section
506E.6.
A1.3. Qualified historic buildings. In addition to or in place of the criteria
allowed by SFEBC Section
506E.2, qualified historical buildings shall be permitted to use structural
engineering criteria provided in the latest edition of the California
Historical Building Code (California Code of Regulations Title 24 Part 8),
subject to the eligibility requirements of that code.
¬†
Commentary: SFEBC Section
504E.5 also mentions the CHBC, but that provision is about historic
preservation in accord with San Francisco Planning Department guidelines and
has no direct bearing on the structural engineering criteria.
A2. Seismicity, Soil, and Geotechnical issues
A2.1. Site Class E. Buildings located in areas labeled ‚ÄúNEHRP E‚Äù on the latest
USGS map of ‚ÄúSoil Type and Shaking Hazard in the San Francisco Bay Area‚Äù will
be assigned to Site Class E unless site-specific investigation in accordance
with ASCE 7-16 Chapter 20 indicates otherwise.
A2.2. Site Class F. The requirement in ASCE 7-16 Section 11.4.8 for site
response analysis of Site Class F sites is waived, such sites should be
considered as Site Class E.
¬†
Commentary: SFEBC Chapter 5E does not require mitigation of existing geologic
site hazards such as liquefiable soil. Also, many buildings subject to Chapter
5E would be exempt from site response analysis by the exception to ASCE 7-16
Section 20.3.1.
A2.3. Seismic ground motion values. Where seismic ground motion values are
calculated per ASCE 7-16 Section 11.4 or by similar provisions, the value of Fa
shall be taken as 1.3 for Site Class E.
¬†
Commentary: This requirement applies to any code-based procedure for calculating
seismicity parameters, such as that used by CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4 and
application of ‚Äúregular code‚Äù provisions through the California Historical
Building Code. It also applies where criteria such as ASCE 31, ASCE 41, and FEMA
P-807 apply equations similar to those in ASCE 7 Section 11.4. When using the USGS
ground motion application, engineers are cautioned to confirm use of the correct
value Fa as described above.
A3. Assessment of Existing Building Conditions
A3.1. Building investigation and report. In support of an engineering
evaluation or retrofit design, the owner shall conduct or cause to be conducted
an investigation of the existing building. The engineer of record shall prepare
a written report documenting procedures, findings, and conclusions of the
investigation. The report may reference other materials submitted to
demonstrate compliance or to support findings and conclusions.
A3.1.1. Scope of investigation. At minimum, the investigation shall comply with
any investigation and assessment provisions in the engineering criteria
selected from SFEBC Section
506E.2, as modified by subsequent Parts of this Bulletin. Otherwise, the
investigation scope and methods may generally be set at the discretion of the
engineer of record, but all findings shall be reported. The Department is
authorized to require additional investigation as needed to fulfill the purpose
of the report and the intent of SFEBC Chapter 5E. With the approval of the
Department, field verification of assumed conditions may be performed during
the construction phase.
As needed or required, the investigation shall include identification,
verification, and assessment of existing conditions relevant to the engineering
assumptions applied in the evaluation or retrofit design. The investigation
shall be based on a combination of non-destructive testing or inspection,
destructive testing or inspection, and reference to record documents. Where
record documents are used to reduce the scope of testing or other on-site work,
appropriate field verification is required.
¬†
Commentary: With respect to evaluation, the primary purpose of the
investigation is to identify or confirm the nature of the existing construction
as needed to justify load drift curves, tributary floor weights, load path
assumptions, etc. A secondary purpose is to provide condition assessment
sufficient to rule out deterioration or construction defects significant enough
to affect earthquake performance of the structure as a whole. The investigation
should therefore seek evidence of damage, deterioration, or defective
construction sufficient to affect significantly the performance of the seismic
force-resisting system. With respect to retrofit design, the primary purpose of
the investigation is to confirm design assumptions regarding the adequacy of
existing seismic load path components within the context of the retrofitted
structure. In addition, though it need not be stated in the provision, the
Department is always authorized to require repair of damage, correction of
defects, and elimination of dangerous conditions; hence the requirement that
‚Äúall findings shall be reported.‚Äù
A3.1.2. Timing of investigation. Unless otherwise required by the engineering
criteria selected from SFEBC Section
506E.2, as modified by subsequent Parts of this Bulletin, with the approval of
the Department, investigation may be deferred to a confirmation or construction
phase. The deferred investigation shall be specified as a special inspection
item in accordance with SFBC
Chapter 17.
¬†
Commentary: This allowance is offered for the benefit of owners for cases in
which destructive investigation will be unusually disruptive or expensive.
However, the owner will bear the risk of change orders, design revisions, and
supplemental design review if actual conditions differ from those assumed by
the evaluation or design. Approval of the Department is required to allow the
Department to identify cases where deferred investigation will complicate its
review and approval process. The Department may allow some parts of the
investigation to be delayed while requiring other parts of the investigation to
be completed prior to review of calculations.
A3.2. Existing materials and components. Where the applicable engineering
criteria specify material or structural properties of existing elements, those
criteria shall be used. Otherwise, the general rules of this section apply.
A3.2.1. Damage and defects. The capacity of any element damaged by
deterioration, wear, or other causes or constructed or altered so as to differ
from its intended condition shall be reduced based on the judgment of the
engineer of record, subject to review of condition assessment findings and the
approval of the Department. This provision shall apply where the applicable
engineering criteria do not make an explicit provision for capacity reduction.
¬†
Commentary: This provision is consistent with ASCE 31-03 Section 4.2.4.4.
A3.2.2. Relation of nominal and expected strength to allowable stress. Where
element capacities are based on allowable stresses from codes and standards,
nominal strengths shall be taken no greater than the allowable stresses
multiplied by the following factors: 1.7 for steel; 2.5 for masonry; 2.0 for
wood. Where the element is ductile or deformation-controlled, the expected
strength shall be taken as 1.25 times the nominal strength.
¬†
Commentary: This provision is consistent with ASCE 31-03 Section 4.2.4.4.
A3.2.3. Concrete footings and stem walls. Evaluation and design of existing
concrete footings shall be permitted to assume default concrete strength based
on ASCE 41-13.
A3.2.4. Unreinforced brick footings. The capacity of an existing brick footing
to resist shear or pullout of an existing or new anchor shall be established by
testing or by reference to approved tests of similar conditions. Where the
capacity of an anchor is limited by failure of the footing or grout, the
anchored wall or frame element shall be considered non-ductile or force-
controlled.
¬†
Commentary: Because FEMA P-807 presumes ductile retrofit elements, the last
sentence of this provision means that retrofit elements designed with FEMA P-
807 may only be used with brick footings when testing has demonstrated that the
anchor will develop the strength of the wall or frame element or will yield
itself in a ductile fashion.
A3.2.5. Concrete or masonry retaining walls.
Reserved.
A3.2.6. Sheathed wood-frame walls and partitions. Wood-frame walls and
partitions shall be permitted to use peak strength values from Bulletin Section
B5.1.1. Where these values are used, they shall be taken as expected strengths
and reduced to nominal strength per Bulletin Section A3.2.2 where used on non-
ductile or force-controlled elements. This provision is subject to the
following limitations:
1.¬†¬†¬†A wall assembly may be considered deformation-controlled if all sheathing
materials that are individually force-controlled are ignored in the strength
calculation.
2.¬†¬†¬†Retrofit designs based on R values from the building code shall use only
code-approved sheathing materials and combinations appropriate to the assumed R
value.
A3.2.7. Anchorage of sill plates.
Sill plates of all walls that are considered to resist seismic shear forces
shall be anchored to the foundation, structural slab or stem walls that they
rest on. Total shear capacity of competent existing bolts and any added anchor
bolts shall be adequate to resist the shear demand on the wall. Anchors in
walls that are not considered to resist seismic shear forces are not required
to be investigated.
When investigation confirms the presence of concrete foundations supporting 2x
or 3x sill plates anchored with ¬Ω" to ¬æ" diameter bolts with washers and nuts,
it is acceptable to determine in-plane shear capacities in accordance with
applicable tables in ANSI/AWC National Design Specification, provided that the
supporting concrete is sound, sill plates are in good condition, anchor bolts
do not show extensive corrosion, and anchors are located in the concrete per
SFBC Section 1905.
The capacity of existing sill plate anchors in brick footings or stem walls
shall be established per Section A3.2.4.
Maximum spacing between existing sill plate anchor bolts shall be six (6) feet
for walls with plywood sheathing and ten (10) feet for other shear walls
(archaic walls). There shall be a minimum of two (2) shear anchors per each
wall segment that is considered to resist seismic forces.
All anchors for which capacity cannot be determined by calculation, or for
which capacities are not published in an approved Standard, may have capacities
established by testing. Anchor bolts that are placed out of plumb, are loose,
show extensive signs of corrosion, or are otherwise damaged shall not be
considered to provide lateral load resistance.
Where new anchors are required, strength, spacing and installation requirements
shall be determined in accordance with the SFBC.
¬†
Commentary: Reliable performance of a lateral load resisting system depends on
the presence of a complete load path, from floor diaphragm through the lateral
load resisting elements and their foundation, to the supporting soils. Absence
of an adequate connection between the wood sill and foundation is a gap in the
load path that limits the ability of the shear wall to resist seismic forces.
A3.2.8. Default strength values for diaphragms. Default values for evaluation
and retrofit design of existing or strengthened diaphragms may be taken from
ASCE 41-13 Table 12-2 or 15-2 when using ASCE 31 or ASCE 41, or from SDPWS-08
Tables 4.2A through 4.2D (AF&PA, 2009) when using CEBC Appendix A- Chapter A4,
with adjustments for nominal v. expected strength, ASD, or LRFD. When using
FEMA P-807, diaphragm strength may be determined using the nominal strength
from ASCE 41 or SDPWS multiplied by phi = 1.0, or peak expected strength as
provided in Table A3.2.8.

Diaphragms for use with FEMA P-807.

Commentary: This section identifies sources of diaphragm capacities suitable
where Chapter 5E requires diaphragm evaluation or strengthening. Table A3.2.8-
1 is for use only with procedures like FEMA P-807 in which capacities are based
on estimated peak strength. Because FEMA P-807 is based on the estimated peak
strength of vertical elements, the diaphragm strength is allowed to be derived
on a similar bases, with a phi factor of 1.0. Expected strengths in Table
A3.2.8-8 are based on test information from APA (Countryman, 1952; Countryman
and Colbenson, 1955) and ABK (1981). Reference to SDPWS in the table is only
for load case diagrams; expected strengths are to be taken from the table.
A4. Structural Calculations and Project Documentation
A4.1. Submittals. Structural calculations and supporting documents shall be
prepared and submitted as required by Bulletin Section A4.2. Other documents
shall be prepared and submitted as required by Administrative Bulletin
106.
A4.2. Structural calculations and supporting documents. Structural calculations
shall be submitted as required to confirm compliance with the selected
engineering criteria. Calculations shall be specific to the engineering
criteria used and shall include, at minimum:
1.¬†¬†¬†A statement that the evaluation or retrofit design was prepared to
demonstrate compliance with SFEBC
Chapter 5E.
2.¬†¬†¬†Identification of the engineering criteria used for the evaluation or
retrofit design, including the performance objective used with FEMA P-807, ASCE
41-06, or ASCE 41-13.
3.¬†¬†¬†All building investigation, soils, geotechnical, or other supporting
reports, as well as a summary of such reports indicating how the findings or
conclusions are reflected in the structural calculations.
4.¬†¬†¬†Identification of structural properties and capacities assumed for all
existing materials and elements, including any capacity reductions for damage,
deterioration, or defect.
5.¬†¬†¬†Identification of structural properties and capacities assumed for all new
materials and elements, including product literature for proprietary devices.
6.¬†¬†¬†If requested by the Department, verification calculations for any
engineering software used.
7.¬†¬†¬†Other information as required by the Department.
A5. Construction Quality Assurance
A5.1. Testing and inspection. All work shall comply with inspection and testing
requirements of the building code as they apply to existing buildings and
structures. Additional field verification, structural observation, testing, and
inspection may be required in accordance with the selected engineering criteria
or as directed by the Department.
A6.1. Use of Steel Special Moment Frames. Special Steel Moment Frames shall
comply with all applicable provisions of AISC 341-10, including but not limited
to connection design and lateral bracing of beams.
Exception: The ‚Äústrong-column/weak-beam‚Äù provision of AISC 341-16, Section
E3.4a is waived, provided that the columns carry no gravity load.
It is permitted to employ approved commercially available proprietary frame
systems to achieve the Special Moment Frame classification.
A6.2. Use of Steel Ordinary Moment Frames or Steel Intermediate Moment Frames.
CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4 allows the use of any seismic force resisting
system permitted in the building code, when the applicable R factor is
employed. The building code (through reference to ASCE7) permits the use of
steel moment frames other than Steel Special Moment Frames in light frame
construction only when specific limitations regarding the building height and
unit weights of floors and walls are met. These limitations are waived for
buildings with no more than three stories above the highest Target Story. The
R, Œ©0, and Cd factors employed shall be those applicable to the selected
system.
A6.3. Use of Cantilevered Column Systems. Cantilevered column systems
conforming to the following provisions may be considered as moment frame
systems (Special, Intermediate, or Ordinary, as applicable, based on detailing)
with regard to determination of the R, Œ©0, and Cd factors.
1.¬†¬†¬†Columns shall not carry gravity load.
2.¬†¬†¬†Columns shall be configured in pairs (or larger groups) connected by a
continuous foundation or grade beam.
3.¬†¬†¬†The continuous foundation or grade beam shall be designed to resist the
expected plastic moment at the base of each column, computed as RyFyZ, as
defined in AISC 341-16.
4.¬†¬†¬†The flexibility of the continuous foundation or grade beam, considering
cracked section properties of reinforced concrete, shall be included in
computing the deformation of the cantilevered column system.
5.¬†¬†¬†Cantilevered columns shall be considered as twice their actual height when
checking lateral torsional buckling.
Part B. APPLICATION OF FEMA P-807 TO EVALUATION AND RETROFIT DESIGN
¬†
            FEMA P-807, unlike the other documents cited by Section
            506E.2, is not a code or standard and is written in a guideline or narrative
            style. Enforceable provisions in ‚Äúcode language‚Äù are therefore provided here,
DISCUSSION: adapted from FEMA P-807 Appendix B. In general, use of FEMA P-807 for compliance
            with SFEBC
            Chapter 5E shall mean compliance with the code language provisions in this
            Bulletin; FEMA P-807 itself constitutes a commentary to these provisions.
B1. Compliance
B1.1. Performance Objective
B1.1.1. Hazard level. The spectral demand shall be 0.5SMS, calculated in
accordance with ASCE 7-16 Section 11.4 except that for sites in Site Class E,
the value of Fa shall be taken as 1.3.
¬†
Commentary: The value of Fa is modified for Site Class E to adjust the demand
for site effects not considered explicitly in the development of FEMA P-807
(see FEMA P-807 section 2.6.1).
B1.1.2. Performance level. Acceptable performance shall be based on drifts
corresponding to the Onset of Strength Loss in the seismic force-resisting
wood-frame elements.
¬†
Commentary: This provision merely reflects the requirements of the ordinance,
referencing the Onset of Strength Loss performance level defined in FEMA P-807.
It does not require any additional work by the engineer, since the Onset of
Strength Loss criteria are already embedded in the criteria given in this
Bulletin.
B1.1.3. Maximum drift limit probability of exceedance. The maximum drift limit
POE for evaluation or retrofit design shall be 30 percent.
Exception: Where the story or underfloor area subject to evaluation or retrofit
contains only parking, storage, or utility uses or occupancies, the maximum
drift limit POE for evaluation or for retrofit design shall be 50 percent, as
long as the additional requirements of Bulletin Section B7.3 are met.
¬†
Commentary: This Exception incorporates the alternative criteria given in SFEBC
Section
506E.3. The alternative criteria apply to what FEMA P-807 calls ‚Äúoptimized
retrofit,‚Äù as discussed in FEMA P-807 Sections 6.3.1 and 6.4.2.
B1.2. Required scope of work. Compliance with the provisions of SFEBC
Chapter 5E using FEMA P-807 requires:
1.¬†¬†¬†Correction of all aspects of eligibility non-compliance per Bulletin
Section B3, and
2.¬†¬†¬†Correction of all building survey non-compliance per Bulletin Section B4,
and either
3a.¬†¬†¬†Demonstration of an acceptable existing condition per Bulletin Section
B6, or
Where retrofit is required but the provisions of Bulletin Section B7 cannot be
satisfied, the building shall be considered ineligible for compliance with
SFEBC
Chapter 5E using FEMA P-807.
B2. Definitions
¬†
Commentary: In some instances, the notation and terminology differ slightly
from those in FEMA P-807 Chapters 1-7.
B2.1. Terminology. Terms used in Bulletin Part B shall have the meanings
provided here. Terms not defined here shall have the meanings provided in the
building code.
CENTER OF STRENGTH. At each story, the location in plan that represents the
weighted average location of the load in all wall lines, at the drift
associated with the story strength.
DRIFT. For a given story, the calculated or postulated lateral deflection
within that story divided by the story height, normally expressed as a
percentage.
FIRST STORY. Any target story subject to SFEBC
Chapter 5E .
LOAD-DRIFT CURVE. For a wall assembly, wall line, or story, the relationship
characterizing the variation of shear resistance versus drift, for the full
range of relevant drifts. For a wall assembly, the load value is given in units
of force per unit length. For wall lines and stories, the load value is given
in units of force.
LOAD-ROTATION CURVE. For a story, the relationship characterizing the variation
of torsional resistance versus story rotation, for the full range of relevant
rotations, given in units of torque as a function of rotation angle.
PROBABILITY OF EXCEEDANCE (POE). The desired or calculated probability that the
structure will respond beyond the drift limits representing the desired
performance level, in at least one direction, when subjected to a specified
hazard level. Within SFEBC
Chapter 5E  and this Bulletin, POE means the probability of exceeding the drift
limits associated with Onset of Strength Loss.
¬†
Commentary: As used in SFEBC
Chapter 5E  and this Bulletin, POE is identical to what FEMA P-807 Chapters 1
through 7 typically call ‚Äúdrift limit POE.‚Äù
QUALIFYING WALL LINE. For purposes of checking eligibility of floor or roof
diaphragms, a wall line that contributes substantially to the peak story
strength and has an adequate load path connecting it to the diaphragms it
affects.
¬†
Commentary: See FEMA P-807 Section 2.6.4 for discussion of rules for
‚Äúqualifying‚Äù wall lines. The definition is subject to the judgment of the
engineer of record and the Department.
SPECTRAL CAPACITY. For a given POE, the highest level of spectral acceleration
a structure can sustain without responding beyond the drift limits representing
the desired performance level, given as a multiple of the acceleration of
gravity, and calculated separately in each principal direction.
SPECTRAL DEMAND. See Bulletin Section B1.1.1. The spectral demand is given as a
multiple of the acceleration of gravity.
STORY. For purposes of applying engineering criteria in SFEBC Section
506E and this Bulletin, see the building code definition and this Bulletin‚Äôs
definition of First Story. The definition in SFEBC Section 503E applies only to
the counting of stories for determining scope per SFEBC Section
502E.
STORY STRENGTH. The maximum load value from the story load-drift curve,
calculated separately in each principal direction.
STORY STRENGTH, BASE-NORMALIZED. The story strength divided by the total
seismic weight of the building.
STORY STRENGTH, STORY-NORMALIZED. The story strength divided by the sum of the
tributary floor weights of all the floors above the story in question.
STORY TORSIONAL STRENGTH. The maximum torsional resistance value from the story
load-rotation curve.
STRENGTH DEGRADATION RATIO. In each direction, a value between 0.0 and 1.0
calculated as the first story strength divided by the load corresponding to a
drift of 3 percent from the first story load-drift curve.
TORSION COEFFICIENT. A value that need not be taken greater than 1.4,
calculated as the first story torsional demand divided by the first story
torsional strength.
TORSIONAL ECCENTRICITY. The absolute value of the plan distance, in x and y
components, between the second story center of strength and the first story
center of strength.
TRIBUTARY FLOOR WEIGHT. The total seismically active weight tributary to a
single floor level comprising dead load and applicable live load, snow weight,
and other loads as required by the building code.
UPPER STORY. Any story above the first story.
WALL ASSEMBLY. A unique combination of sheathing materials over wood-stud
framing.
WALL LINE. A collection of full-height and partial-height wall segments or
frames within a single story that satisfies the rules in Bulletin Section
B5.1.2.
¬†
Commentary: A wood-frame wall line is generally assumed to contribute strength
only in the direction parallel to its length. A wall line expected to
contribute strength in a direction other than parallel to its length, such as a
cantilever column or fixed-based moment frame, must be modeled appropriately.
WALL SEGMENT. A portion of wood-frame wall made from a single wall assembly.
For purposes of this definition, any sheathed run of wood-stud framing that
could contribute to a story‚Äôs lateral strength or stiffness shall be considered
a potential wall segment, whether or not the framing and sheathing were
intentionally designed, detailed, sized, or located to contribute that strength
or stiffness.
B2.2. Notation
AU¬†¬†¬†The base-normalized upper-story strength, calculated separately for each
direction.
AW¬†¬†¬†The weak-story ratio, calculated separately for each direction.

story i.
ex, ey¬†¬†¬†The x and y components, respectively, of the torsional eccentricity.

H1¬†¬†¬†The floor-to-ceiling height of the tallest first story wall line,
determined separately in each direction.
I¬†¬†¬†A subscript index indicating floor or story. Story i is between floor i and
floor i+1.
Lw¬†¬†¬†The length of wall line w, taken as the longest possible length of wall
that satisfies the rules in Bulletin Section B5.1.2, including the length of
any openings within it.

Œîi¬†¬†¬†In each direction, the drift at which the story strength of story i
occurs.
J1¬†¬†¬†The first story torsional demand.
B3. Eligibility
B3.1. General. Buildings that do not comply with the requirements of Bulletin
Section B3 shall be considered ineligible for compliance using FEMA P-807.
Exception: Buildings in which all aspects of non-compliance will be eliminated
through alteration or retrofit are eligible for compliance using FEMA P-807.
B3.2. Massing
1.¬†¬†¬†The building has no more than four stories above grade plane at any point
around its perimeter.
2.¬†¬†¬†The building‚Äôs wood-framed stories are not supported by an above-grade
podium structure.
¬†
Commentary: Item 1 relies on the building code‚Äôs definition of story above
grade plane. Item 2 is referring to a concrete podium structure generally
extending at least one story above grade and topped by a concrete diaphragm
that provides a base for wood framing above. Item 2 is not intended to rule out
concrete foundation elements or stem walls that extend above grade.
B3.3. Upper stories
1.¬†¬†¬†The upper-story seismic force-resisting systems are bearing wall or
building frame systems of wood-frame walls with shear panels.
2.¬†¬†¬†The upper-story floor-to-floor heights are between 8 feet and 12 feet and
are constant within each story.
3.¬†¬†¬†In each upper story, in each principal direction, the distance from the
center of strength to the center of mass of the floor below it is no more than
25 percent of the corresponding building dimension.
¬†
Commentary: The intent of this approximate rule is to ensure that no upper
story is prone to significant torsion, and that inertial forces from upper
stories should transfer to the first story near the geometric center of the
second floor. See FEMA P-807 Section 2.6.2.
4.¬†¬†¬†No upper story or floor above an upper story has a weight irregularity as
defined by ASCE/SEI 7-16 Table 12.3-2, Type 2.
5.¬†¬†¬†No upper story has a vertical geometric irregularity as defined by ASCE/
SEI 7-16 Table 12.3-2, Type 3.
B3.4. First story, basement and foundation
1.¬†¬†¬†The first story height may vary, but the maximum first story height, from
top of foundation to top of second floor framing is between 8 feet and 15 feet.
2.¬†¬†¬†The first story seismic force-resisting systems are bearing wall or
building frame systems of wood-frame walls with shear panels or combine such
systems with steel moment-resisting frame systems, steel cantilever column
systems, or steel buckling-restrained braced frame systems.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 is not suitable for evaluating or designing
concentrically braced frames, concrete shear walls, or reinforced masonry shear
walls. See FEMA P-807 Section 6.5. If these systems exist or are proposed for
as retrofit elements, compliance must be demonstrated using one of the other
methods allowed by SFEBC Section 506E.2.
3.¬†¬†¬†The first story includes no full-height concrete or masonry walls.
¬†
Commentary: Buildings with full-height concrete or masonry walls at the full
perimeter of the story of interest are expected to be exempt from SFEBC Chapter
5E. Buildings with a combination of full-height concrete or masonry walls and
other systems (wood-frame walls, steel moment frames, etc.) might be required
to comply with SFEBC Chapter 5E but will not be able to use FEMA P-807 to
demonstrate compliance.
4.¬†¬†¬†The first story walls and frames have continuous concrete footings or
concrete slab-on-grade foundations. If some or all of the first floor is raised
over a crawl space, the crawl space has concrete stem walls to the underside of
the first floor framing.
¬†
Commentary: Concrete stem walls are considered to provide a base similar to a
concrete foundation. Wood-framed cripple walls, whether braced or unbraced by
sheathing of any type, are not adequate to meet this provision.
5.¬†¬†¬†First story walls and frames may be partial height over a concrete or
reinforced masonry retaining wall or foundation stem wall, but any partial-
height wall or frame is at least four feet tall from top of stem wall to
underside of second floor framing.
6.¬†¬†¬†If the building has a basement, the basement walls and the floor diaphragm
just above them are capable of transferring seismic forces between the
foundation and the first story, and the basement story is laterally stronger
than the first story above it.
B3.5. Floor and roof diaphragms. Floor and roof diaphragms shall satisfy the
eligibility requirements of this subsection.
Exception: Diaphragms shown to have no deficiencies or irregularities that
would prevent development of the strength of any seismic force-resisting wall
or frame or would otherwise control the overall seismic response of the
structure need not satisfy the eligibility requirements in this subsection.
¬†
Commentary: The intent of these approximate rules for diaphragms is to ensure
that the structure does not develop a premature mechanism or failure mode. See
FEMA P-807 Section 2.6.4 for additional explanation and guidance.
1.¬†¬†¬†No portion of the second floor diaphragm between qualifying wall lines has
an aspect ratio greater than 2:1.
2.¬†¬†¬†The second floor diaphragm does not cantilever more than 25 feet from a
qualifying wall line.
3.¬†¬†¬†If the second floor diaphragm cantilevers more than 10 feet from a
qualifying wall line, diaphragm chords are adequate to develop the lesser of
the strength of the diaphragm or the diaphragm forces associated with the peak
strength of the qualifying wall line.
4.¬†¬†¬†No floor or roof diaphragm has a reentrant corner irregularity in which
either projecting leg of the diaphragm beyond the reentrant corner is longer
than 15 percent of the corresponding plan dimension of the building, unless
each leg of the diaphragm satisfies the aspect ratio and cantilever rules of
this subsection.
¬†
Commentary: This provision differs from the irregularity defined in ASCE/SEI
31-03 or as Type 2 in ASCE/SEI 7-16 Table 12.3-1 in order to limit diaphragm
demands. See FEMA P-807 Section 2.6.4.
5.¬†¬†¬†No floor or roof diaphragm has a vertical offset unless load path
components are present and adequate to develop the diaphragm strength across
the offset.
6.¬†¬†¬†No floor or roof diaphragm has cutouts or openings within it such that,
along any line across the diaphragm, the sum of the opening widths along that
line is more than 25 percent of the overall diaphragm dimension along that
line.
B4. Building Survey
B4.1. General. Structural components shall be investigated in accordance with
Bulletin Section B4 as needed to confirm eligibility per Bulletin Section B3
and to support structure characterization per Bulletin Section B5, evaluation
per Bulletin Section B6, and retrofit design per Bulletin Section B7.
B4.2. Wall framing and sheathing. The investigation shall determine the length
and location in plan of all wall segments and wall lines in all stories as
needed to calculate load-drift curves.
The investigation shall determine the size and location of openings in each
wall line as needed to calculate adjustment factors for openings and adjustment
factors for overturning.
The investigation shall determine all unique frames or wall assemblies in the
first story and representative wall assemblies in the upper stories. Where
sheathing includes wood structural panels or where sheathing load-drift data is
a function of nailing, the investigation shall also determine the nail size and
edge nail spacing. Panel edge nailing shall be investigated over at least five
nail spaces and as needed to confirm a reliable spacing assumption.
¬†
Commentary: Unless building-specific conditions indicate a need for more
extensive investigation, the minimum recommended investigation should include
one location of each distinct wall assembly in the first story and in any upper
story, but not less than one perimeter and one interior wall line in the first
story and in any upper story. If prior investigation reports based on
destructive investigation are available, they may be relied on. If original
drawings are available, they may be relied on to reduce the scope of
investigation, but some investigation is still necessary to confirm the
reliability of the drawings.
B4.3. Floor and roof framing and diaphragm. The investigation shall determine
the construction of floor and roof framing and diaphragm sheathing, including
the direction of framing and the mechanism of gravity load transfer, as needed
for calculation of adjustment factors for overturning. The second floor shall
be investigated. Subject to approval of the Department, the roof and upper
floors need not be investigated in detail where there is evidence that their
relevant attributes are similar to those of the second floor.
B4.4. Load path components. The investigation shall determine the nature of the
load path components and connections for transfer of forces between diaphragms
and walls or frames as needed to confirm that the wall line will participate in
resisting drift.
¬†
Commentary: For non-WSP sheathing, the intent is to confirm that fastening
reasonably conforms to conventional construction requirements. For existing WSP
shear walls with nail spacing closer than six inches, it should be confirmed at
representative locations that shear wall top and bottom connection capacity is
appropriate to the sheathing capacity.
The investigation shall determine the presence or absence of hold-down hardware
at the base of all first story walls, as well as the adequacy of installation
of representative types at representative locations.
The investigation shall confirm that anchors are provided at the base of the
first story walls.
Table B4.4 shows where the load path may be assumed adequate or is subject to
investigation or confirmation. Table B4.4 applies only to walls whose strength
is counted in the analysis. For any condition subject to investigation, the
load path may be assumed lacking, and the corresponding wall strength may be
ignored, but only if assumed so consistently throughout the building.
¬†
Commentary: The load path may be assumed lacking, but not selectively so as to
‚Äúcorrect‚Äù torsion or other irregularities. This provision is similar to ASCE 31 and
ASCE 41 limits on the designation of secondary components.
Exception: Wherever the strength of two stories is being compared, an adequate
load path must be assumed for all walls and partitions in the upper story.
¬†
Commentary: The exception prevents underestimating the upper story strength.
The exception will apply for calculations of weak story or soft story ratio in
ASCE 31/41, CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4, and other code-based procedures;
application of the 1.3 cap on retrofit strength for ASCE 41 and CEBC Appendix A
- Chapter A4 retrofits; and calculation of spectral capacity with FEMA P-807.
The adequacy of an investigated load path may be confirmed by the judgment of
the design professional, without calculations, but is subject to approval by
the Department. Judgment should be based on the presence of a positive
connection with multiple or redundant attachments distributed over the length
of the wall line. For partitions perpendicular to floor framing above, blocking
between floor joists nailed to the partition top plate (through a lath nailer,
if present) should be deemed adequate for partitions with non-WSP sheathing.

B4.5. Foundation elements. The investigation shall determine the nature of the
existing foundation elements and supporting soils as needed for calculation of
adjustment factors for overturning.
B5. Structure Characterization
B5.1. Story strength
B5.1.1. Wall assemblies. For each wall assembly present, a load-drift curve
shall be computed by summing contributions from Table B5.1.1 at each drift
level for each layer of sheathing. With approval of the Department, test
results specific to the wall assembly or its components may be used in place of
Table B5.1.1.
¬†
Commentary: See FEMA P-807 Section 4.4 and Appendix F regarding the development
of Table B5.1.1 and the use of alternate test data.
The values in Table B5.1.1 are subject to the following additional
requirements:
1.¬†¬†¬†Horizontal wood sheathing or wood siding shall be at least 1/2" thick and
fastened to existing studs with at least two nails per board per stud.
Otherwise, the expected strength shall be taken as 0.
2.¬†¬†¬†Where siding panel edges are lapped, each panel shall be nailed
separately. Otherwise, the expected strength shall be taken as 0.

B5.1.1.1. Wall assemblies without wood structural panel sheathing. The assembly
load drift curve is the sum of the load drift curves for each of the sheathing
layers.
B5.1.1.2. Wall assemblies with wood structural panel sheathing. The assembly
load drift curve is whichever of the following two load-drift curves has the
larger peak strength:
1.¬†¬†¬†The assembly load-drift curve using 50 percent of the strength of the wood
structural panel layers and 100 percent of the strength of the other sheathing
materials.
2.¬†¬†¬†The assembly load-drift curve using 100 percent of the strength of the
wood structural panel layers and 50 percent of the strength of the other
sheathing materials.
B5.1.2. Wall line assignment. Each segment of sheathed wall framing within a
story shall be assigned to a wall line. Wall lines shall satisfy the following
rules:
1.¬†¬†¬†Full-height wall segments separated by window or door openings but
connected by sheathed segments and continuous framing above or below the
opening shall be assigned to the same wall line, unless other rules require
them to be treated separately.
2.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments assigned to the same wall line shall not be offset out-of-
plane from adjacent segments by more than four feet.
3.¬†¬†¬†At bay windows, the wall segments within the common plane shall be
assigned to the same wall line if they satisfy the other rules, but the wall
segments within the cantilevered portions of the bay shall not be counted
toward the wall-line strength.
4.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments of different heights, including wall segments along a
stepped foundation, shall be assigned to separate wall lines.
5.¬†¬†¬†A wall segment of varying height due to a sloped foundation shall be
assigned to a separate wall line, and its height shall be taken as the average
height of the segment.
6.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments of different wall assemblies shall be assigned to separate
wall lines.
7.¬†¬†¬†Where hold-downs exist at each end of a wall segment, that segment may be
considered a separate wall line.
8.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments less than one foot long shall be treated as openings.
9.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments between openings with height-to-length ratios greater than
8:1 shall be treated as openings.
10.¬†¬†¬†Steel elements (moment frames, cantilever columns, etc.) shall be
assigned to separate wall lines.
11.¬†¬†¬†Wall segments or frames considered to have significant damage,
deterioration, or construction defects may be counted toward a wall line‚Äôs
strength but shall have their load-drift strength values reduced.
B5.1.3. Wall line load-drift curve. For each wall line, a load-drift curve
shall be computed by multiplying the applicable wall assembly load-drift curve
by the wall line‚Äôs length and by applicable adjustment factors per Bulletin
Equation B5.1.3-1.
fw = (vw)(Lw)(Qopen)(Qot)¬†¬†¬†(Equation B5.1.3-1)
where:
fw is the load-drift curve of wall line w, expressed as a function of drift.
vw is the load-drift curve of the wall assembly associated with wall line w, as
derived per Bulletin Section B5.1.1 and adjusted for height variation per
Bulletin Section B5.1.3.1.
B5.1.3.1. Adjustment for height variation. Where first story wall lines in a
given direction are of different heights, the load-drift curve of the wall
assembly of each wood-frame wall line shall be adjusted to account for
increased drift demands in all but the tallest first story wall line. This may
be done by shifting the assembly load-drift curve from the standard set of
drifts given in Table B5.1.1 to an adjusted set of drifts for each wall line,
given by Equation B5.1.3.1-1.

B5.1.3.2 Adjustment for openings. Each wall line load-drift curve shall account
for the effects of openings within it. This may be done by applying the
adjustment factor for openings, given by Equation B5.1.3.2-1 and Equation
B5.1.3.2-2.

B5.1.3.3. Adjustment for overturning. Each wall line load-drift curve shall
account for the effects of overturning demand and resistance. This may be done
by applying the adjustment factor for overturning, given by Equation B5.1.3.3-
1 or, for existing upper-story wall lines only, by Table B5.1.3.3.

¬†
B5.1.4. Story load-drift curves. For each story, in each direction, a load-
drift curve shall be computed by adding the load-drift curves of all the walls
in that story and aligned in that direction.
¬†
Commentary: Where all the wall line load-drift curves are mapped to the same
set of drifts, the summation is straightforward. Where some first story wall
lines have load-drift curves mapped to a height-adjusted set of drifts, load
values at the standard drift values should be determined by linear
interpolation. Once interpolated values are calculated, the various load- drift
curves can again be added in a straightforward way based on the standard drift
values. See FEMA P-807 Section 4.6 for additional discussion.
B5.2. First story torsion
B5.2.1. Center of strength. The center of strength for the first and second
stories shall be determined based on the wall line loads at the drift at which
the story strength in the corresponding story and direction occurs.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 Section 4.6.4 illustrates the calculation of the center
of strength.
B5.2.2. First story torsional demand. The first story torsional demand
represents the effect of the first story strength acting at the torsional
eccentricity, given by Equation B5.2.2-1.
œÑ1 = exV1y + eyV1x¬†¬†¬†¬†(Equation B5.2.2-1)
B5.2.3. First story load-rotation curve. For the first story, a load-rotation
curve shall be derived, relating torsion about the story center of strength to
the resulting rotation of the story, assuming a rigid second floor diaphragm
and accounting for the load-drift behavior of each first story wall line. The
load-rotation curve shall consider rotation angles up to at least the rotation
associated with 5 percent in-plane drift in at least one first story wall line.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 Section 4.6.6 illustrates one method for calculating of
the load-rotation curve, dividing the rotation range of interest into ten even
increments.
B5.3. Characteristic coefficients
B5.3.1. Base-normalized upper-story strength. The base-normalized upper-story
strength shall be calculated for each principal direction per Equation B5.3.1-

curves.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 Section 4.7.4 illustrates the calculation of the
strength degradation ratio.
B5.3.4. Torsion coefficient. The torsion coefficient, given by Equation B5.3.4-
1, need not be taken greater than 1.4.

each principal direction per Equation B5.3.5-1, where H1 is given in inches.
Qs = 0.55 + 0.0047 H1¬†¬†¬†¬†(Equation B5.3.5-1)
B6. Evaluation
B6.1. Evaluation relative to the performance objective. Subject to the
additional requirements of Bulletin Section B1.2, any eligible structure shall
be deemed to comply with the requirements of this Bulletin if its spectral
capacity in each principal direction exceeds the spectral demand.
B6.1.1. Spectral capacity. Spectral capacity in each direction shall be
calculated from Equations B6.1.1-1 through B6.1.1-5, using drift limit POE
adjustment factors given in Table B6.1.1 for the drift limit POE specified in
Bulletin Section B1.1.3. Drift limit POE adjustment factors for intermediate
values of drift limit POE shall be calculated by linear interpolation.
¬†
Commentary: SFEBC Chapter 5E does not require the calculation of a POE.
However, given a spectral demand, the POE of a structure can be calculated. See
FEMA P-807 Section 5.4.2 or Appendix B model provision 6.2.

B7. Retrofit
B7.1. Retrofitted first story strength. The first story strength of the
retrofitted structure shall account for all existing unaltered elements,
existing altered elements, new elements provided to increase story strength,
and new elements provided to correct aspects of eligibility or building survey
non-compliance.
Exception: Out-of-plane or weak axis strength of existing or retrofit elements
need not be considered where the sum of those strengths is deemed insignificant
to the total story strength.
¬†
Commentary: The Exception is intended to allow wood frame walls and pin-based
frames to be ignored in their weak directions, and to allow the Department to
accept the engineer‚Äôs judgment or to require modeling of fixed-based frames and
cantilever columns in their weak directions.
B7.2. Retrofit compliance. The retrofit design shall demonstrate that both of
the following conditions are true:
1.¬†¬†¬†The retrofitted structure‚Äôs spectral capacity in each principal direction
exceeds the spectral demand.
2.¬†¬†¬†The first story strength of the retrofitted structure in each principal
direction satisfies Equation B7.2-1.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/9887a9d0915fb375869a29c3be3007db4c088e22/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3761.png]¬†¬†¬†¬†(Equation B7.2-1)
¬†
Commentary: The intent of Equation B7.2-1 is to ensure that over-strengthening
the first story is not miscounted as beneficial. Given the maximum POE, if the
required first story strength cannot be achieved without exceeding this limit,
it indicates that the proposed retrofit would push failure to the second story
and would not achieve its intended effect. Where the exception to Bulletin
Section B1.1.3 is applied, the higher POE value will give the same spectral
capacity for less first story strength, effectively allowing a lighter retrofit
that might satisfy the equation.
FEMA P-807 Section 6.2.1 provides formulas for estimating the strength of the
retrofitted first story needed to reach the required spectral capacity, but use
of the estimating formulas is not required.
B7.3 Additional requirements where the Exception to Bulletin Section B1.1.3 is
applied. The retrofit design shall demonstrate that all of the following
additional conditions is true:
1.¬†¬†¬†The first story strength of the retrofitted structure in each principal
direction satisfies Equation B7.3-1.
2.¬†¬†¬†The retrofit design satisfies the requirements of Bulletin Section B7.3.1.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3763.png]¬†¬†¬†¬†(Equation B7.3-1)
B7.3.1 Minimized torsional eccentricity. Retrofit elements shall be located
along perimeter wall lines so as to minimize the torsional eccentricity of the
retrofitted structure, or so as to satisfy Equations B7.3.1-1 and B7.3.1-2.
This requirement may be waived with the approval of the Department to
accommodate other building or planning code requirements or to avoid
disproportionate construction costs.

B7.4 Design criteria for retrofit elements. Retrofit elements shall conform to
the general requirements in this section and to the applicable requirements in
the following subsections.
¬†
Commentary: See Bulletin Section B3.4 for discussion of retrofit systems for
which FEMA P-807 is suitable.
1.¬†¬†¬†Where retrofit elements are sized based on unit strengths from codes or
standards, the expected strength, without strength reductions or resistance
factors, may be used.
¬†
Commentary: The allowance of expected strength, which is typically greater than
nominal strength (see Bulletin Section A3.2.2) is appropriate because FEMA P-
807 requires retrofit elements to be ductile (or, in ASCE 31 or ASCE 41 terms,
deformation-controlled).
2.¬†¬†¬†The load-drift curve of each retrofit element type shall be based on
expected material properties, including overstrength. The full expected
capacity, without strength reduction or resistance factors, shall be used to
calculate load-drift curves and peak strengths.
3.¬†¬†¬†Each retrofit element shall be such that a load-drift curve based on
similar elements alone would have a strength degradation ratio, CD, greater
than or equal to 0.8.
4.¬†¬†¬†The load-drift curve of each retrofit element type shall be defined up to
five percent interstory drift or as needed to fully characterize the retrofit
design per Bulletin Section B5.
5.¬†¬†¬†Materials and systems for all retrofit elements shall be generally
consistent with provisions of the building code for new construction of the
same occupancy and risk category. SFEBC Section 302.4 and other provisions that
allow like materials for alterations do not apply to retrofits mandated by
SFEBC Chapter 5E. However, the Department may waive restrictions on certain
systems based on building height, irregularity, seismic design category, or
other conditions not related to the critical deficiencies of the story being
evaluated or retrofitted.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 presumes that retrofit elements will be reliably ductile
(as indicated by the requirement for a minimum CD value in item 3 above).
Systems detailed as special should generally be deemed to comply with this
requirement, but systems detailed as intermediate or ordinary may also be shown
to be adequate. The final sentence of this provision allows intermediate and
ordinary steel frames to be used in seismic design category D and E; see also
ASCE 7-16 Sections 12.2.5.6 and 12.2.5.7.
6.¬†¬†¬†Design criteria for load path components and connections shall be
appropriate to the performance objective and shall be based on the building
code for new construction, appropriate provisions of other criteria allowed by
SFEBC Section 506E.2, or principles of capacity design.
B7.4.1. Wood structural panel shear walls. Load-drift curves for wood
structural panel retrofit elements shall be calculated in accordance with
Bulletin Section B5. Existing shear walls modified by replacing sheathing
materials or by adding supplemental wood structural panels shall be considered
retrofit elements.
B7.4.2. Steel special moment-resisting frames. Steel retrofit elements that
conform to the requirements of AISC 341-05 or AISC 341-10 for Special Moment
Frames shall be deemed to comply with the provision requiring a CD value
greater than or equal to 0.8. The load-drift curve may be characterized per
FEMA P-807 Figure 6-7 as follows: Vy = ZFye with post-yield strengthening up to
1.2Vy at dmax, with dmax = dy + 4%.
B7.4.3. Steel intermediate moment-resisting frames. For steel retrofit elements
that conform to the requirements of AISC 341 for Intermediate Moment Frames,
the load-drift curve may be characterized per FEMA P-807 Figure 6-7 as follows:
Vy = ZFye with no post-yield strengthening, and dmax = dy + 2%.
B7.4.4. Steel ordinary moment-resisting frames. For steel retrofit elements
that conform to the requirements of AISC 341 for Ordinary Moment Frames, the
load-drift curve may be characterized per FEMA P-807 Figure 6-7 as follows: Vy
per AISC 360 Chapter F, using Fye instead of Fy, dmax = 2%.
B7.4.5. Steel special cantilever columns. For steel retrofit elements that
conform to the requirements of AISC 341 for Special Cantilevered Column
systems, the load-drift curve may be characterized per FEMA P-807 Figure 6-7 as
follows: Vy = ZFye with no post-yield strengthening, and dmax = dy + 2%.
B7.4.6. Steel ordinary cantilever columns. FEMA P-807 shall not be used to
demonstrate compliance of steel ordinary cantilever columns as retrofit
elements.
B7.4.7. Steel buckling-restrained braced frames. Steel retrofit elements that
conform to the requirements of AISC 341 for buckling-restrained braced frames
shall be deemed to comply with the provision requiring a CD value greater than
or equal to 0.8.
¬†
Commentary: FEMA P-807 Section 6.5.5 offers further guidance on characterizing
and designing these elements.
B7.4.8. Damping systems. FEMA P-807 may be used to demonstrate compliance of
hysteretic damping systems that rely on the yielding of steel components by
modeling the retrofit elements as bi-linear systems similar to other structural
steel systems. The Department is authorized to require third party peer review
at the expense of the permit applicant.
FEMA P-807 shall not be used to demonstrate compliance of other damping
systems, including viscous- or friction-damped systems.
¬†
Commentary: Viscous- and friction-damped systems cannot be designed with FEMA
P-807 because the FEMA P-807 surrogate models did not include these mechanisms.
B7.5 Design criteria for load path elements and components. The retrofit design
shall confirm or provide a load path from the second floor diaphragm through
the first story seismic force-resisting elements and their foundations, to the
supporting soils. The ultimate strength of load path components shall be
reduced with strength reduction factors as needed to ensure that the load-path
elements are able to develop the strength and the intended mechanism of first
story wall and frame elements. Specific design criteria may be derived from
principles of capacity design, from other criteria allowed by SFEBC Section
506E.2, or from building code provisions for new construction involving the
overstrength factor, Œ©0.
B7.5.1. Foundations and overturning. New foundation elements shall be provided
as needed to resist bearing, sliding, and overturning forces associated with
the retrofit elements acting at their strength. Connections and load path
components related to wall or frame overturning shall not assume any acting
dead load except for the self-weight of the retrofit element unless the
retrofit element incorporates existing gravity load-carrying framing or unless
the design and construction explicitly transfer existing dead load to the
retrofit element. The weight of foundation elements may be considered if
adequately connected.
B7.5.2. Second floor diaphragm. The second floor diaphragm shall be
strengthened as needed to ensure that expected forces can be transferred
between the diaphragm and the first-story elements.
B7.5.3. Fixed-base frame columns. Moment-resisting frame systems and cantilever
column systems whose capacity assumes other than a pin-based condition shall be
provided with connection details demonstrated to develop the assumed fixity and
the assumed column strength. In general, an anchor-bolted base plate without
substantial embedment within a foundation element is not considered to provide
a fixed-base condition.
B8. Design quality assurance
B8.1. Structural calculations. Structural calculations and documentation of
evaluations and retrofit designs using FEMA P-807 shall include, at minimum:
1.¬†¬†¬†Plans and/or elevations for each floor level identifying each wall line
and showing the wall assembly, length, location, and openings.
2.¬†¬†¬†A schedule of wall assemblies and load drift curves for existing, altered,
and new elements.
3.¬†¬†¬†A list or schedule of wall lines with overturning and opening adjustments.
4.¬†¬†¬†Derivation of characteristic coefficients.
5.¬†¬†¬†Spectral capacity calculations.

Part F. APPLICATION OF THE CURRENT EDITION OF CEBC APPENDIX A - CHAPTER A4 TO
RETROFIT DESIGN
F1. Modifications and interpretations of CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4.
Compliance with SFEBC Chapter 5E using CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4 shall
require compliance with that code chapter and its reference codes and standards
except as otherwise modified, waived, or interpreted in this section and
Bulletin Part A.
The following modifications and interpretations refer to Appendix A - Chapter
A4 section numbers.
A401.1 Purpose
¬†
Commentary: This provision refers to ‚Äúminimum standards.‚Äù In the context of
Appendix A - Chapter A4, this means minimum standards for policy equivalence
with other criteria when retrofit is triggered elsewhere in the CEBC. In the
context of SFEBC Chapter 5E, the provisions of Appendix A - Chapter A4 might or
might not require the same scope of retrofit as other criteria allowed by SFEBC
Section 506E.2. The other criteria are acceptable even if they require less
retrofit scope or produce retrofit designs with lower capacity than Appendix A
- Chapter A4.
A401.2 Scope. Omit.
¬†
Commentary: When used for compliance with SFEBC Chapter5E, the scope and
applicability of Appendix A - Chapter A4 is established by Ordinance 66-13. The
absence of any condition listed by Section A401.2 has no bearing on compliance
with Chapter 5E.
A402 Definitions. Add, omit, or revise the following definitions as follows:
BUILDING CODE. The current San Francisco Building Code.
GROUND FLOOR. A target story, generally a basement story that extends above
grade or the first story above grade plane. Alternately, depending on context,
GROUND FLOOR might mean the floor level at the base of a target story.
A403.1. Omit the exception and revise the first sentence as follows:
A403.1 General. All modifications required ... the building code provisions for
new construction, except as modified by this chapter and applicable
Administrative Bulletins.
¬†
Commentary: The exception is not necessary because Section A404 is omitted. See
below.
A403.2. Omit the exception and revise the provision as follows:
A403.2 Scope of analysis. This chapter requires the alteration, repair,
replacement or addition of structural elements and their connections to meet
the strength and stiffness requirements herein. The lateral-load-path analysis
shall include the resisting elements and connections from the wood diaphragm
immediately above any target story to the foundation soil interface. Stories
above the uppermost target story shall be considered in the analysis but need
not be modified. The lateral-load-path analysis for added structural elements
shall also include evaluation of the allowable soil-bearing and lateral
pressures in accordance with the building code. Where any portion of a building
within the scope of this chapter is constructed on or into a slope, the lateral
force-resisting system at and below the first story above grade plane shall be
analyzed for the effects of concentrated lateral forces caused by this hillside
condition.
A403.3. Correct Œî0 to Œ©0 in multiple places. Also, add the following sentences
at the end of the section:
A403.3 Design base shear and design parameters. ... Despite any other
requirement of Section A403.3 or A403.4, the total expected strength of
retrofit elements added to any target story need not exceed 1.3 times the
expected strength of the story immediately above, as long as the retrofit
elements are located symmetrically about the center of mass of the story above
or so as to minimize torsion in the target story.
¬†
Commentary: The added sentence implements the SEAONC recommendation to cap the
required strength, consistent with FEMA P-807.
Exception 4: For retrofit systems involving different seismic force-resisting
systems in the same direction within the same story, resisting elements are
permitted to be designed using the least value of R for the different
structural systems found in each independent line of resistance if the
following conditions are met: (1) Risk Category I or II building, (2) four
stories or less above grade plane, and (3) the seismic force-resisting systems
are composed of WSP shear walls, steel moment-resisting frames, steel
cantilever columns, and steel braced frames. Values for Cd and Œ©0 shall be
consistent with the R value used.
Add the following subsection:
A403.3.1 Story strength. Calculation of story strength and identification of
irregularities in Section A403.3 shall be based on the expected strength of all
wall lines, even if sheathed with nonconforming materials. The strength of a
wall line may be reduced to account for inadequate load path or overturning
resistance.
¬†
Commentary: The expected strength of the story above may be calculated using
the FEMA P-807 criteria given in Bulletin Section B5.1. The requirement to
assume an adequate load path prevents underestimating the upper story strength.
It will apply for calculations of weak story or soft story ratio in ASCE 31/41,
CEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4, and other code-based procedures; application of
the 1.3 cap on retrofit strength for ASCE 41 and IEBC Appendix A - Chapter A4
retrofits; and calculation of spectral capacity with FEMA P-807.
A403.5. Revise the subsection heading and the provision as follows:
A403.5. Deformation Compatibility and PŒî effects. The requirements of the
building code shall apply, except as modified herein. All structural framing
elements and their connections not required by design to be part of the lateral
force-resisting system shall be designed and/or detailed to be adequate to
maintain support of expected gravity loads when subjected to the expected
deformations caused by seismic forces. Increased demand due to PŒî effects and
story side sway stability shall be considered in retrofit stories that rely on
the strength and stiffness of cantilever columns for lateral resistance.
¬†
Commentary: This revision is consistent with a change approved for the latest
edition of IEBC.
A403.8. Revise the provision as follows:
A403.8 Horizontal diaphragms. The diaphragm immediately above the target story
shall be evaluated and/or strengthened as required by Bulletin Section A1.1.
Rotational effects shall be accounted for when asymmetric wall stiffness
increases shear demands.
¬†
Commentary: This revision is consistent with a change approved for the latest
edition of IEBC.
A403.9.1 Revise the provision as follows:
A403.9.1 Gypsum or cement plaster products. Gypsum or cement plaster products
shall not be used to provide lateral resistance in a target story.
A404. Omit Section A404 entirely.
¬†
Commentary: Section A404 applies to two-story buildings only. Two-story
buildings are exempt from SFEBC Chapter 5E.
A405.1. Revise the provision as follows:
A405.1 New materials. New materials shall meet the requirements of the building
code, except where allowed by this chapter or applicable Administrative
Bulletins.
A407 Quality Control. Omit Section A407 entirely.
¬†
Commentary: Bulletin Sections A4 and A5, as well as AB 106, apply instead.
Part G. GUIDELINES FOR ALTERNATIVE RATIONAL DESIGN BASES
¬†
               Further development of this section is expected as needed to
               address issues specific to
               Chapter 5E. Sections to be outlined below will cover broad
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬issues consistent with
               Chapter 5E. Otherwise, use of this standard is subject to
               existing Department procedures for implementation of SFBC
               104A.2.8, Alternate materials, design, and methods of
               construction.

AB-108 Application of California Existing Building Code, Appendix Chapter A3
¬†
NO. AB-108¬†¬†¬¬†
DATE¬†¬†¬†:    April 16, 2014 (Updated 01/01/2023 for code references)
SUBJECT¬†¬†¬†: Permit Processing and Issuance
TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Application of California Existing Building Code, Appendix Chapter A3
               The purpose of this Bulletin is to detail procedures for the application of
               California Existing Building Code (CEBC), Appendix Chapter A3, Prescriptive
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: Provisions for Seismic Strengthening of Cripple Walls and Sill Plate Anchorage
               of Light, Wood-Frame Residential Buildings. This Bulletin also provides guidance
               for property owners which to take advantage of the incentive programs being
               offered by the California Residential Mitigation Program.
               Current edition of the California Existing Building Code (CEBC), Appendix
REFERENCE¬†¬†¬†Chapter A3
               California Residential Mitigation Program‚Äôs Earthquake Brace and Bolt website:
               http://www.earthquakebracebolt.com/
               CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3 has been adopted as part of the California Code of
               Regulations, Title 24, Part 10. This code supplements the California Building
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬Code, Title 24, Part 2. It provides prescriptive provisions for voluntary
               seismic strengthening of foundations, cripple walls and sill plate anchorage of
               certain wood-frame residential buildings.
¬†
Due to restrictions on cripple wall height, the prescriptive provisions of
CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3 apply to a limited number of buildings in San
Francisco. Where the prescriptive limits for height of cripple walls are
exceeded, buildings may be considered to meet CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3 when
approved by the Department.
The voluntary implementation of the strengthening provisions of CEBC, Appendix
Chapter A3 can be expected to reduce earthquake damage in residential
buildings; however such provisions are not intended to meet any specific
seismic performance goal. The strengthening of individual buildings will result
in an improvement in the resilience of citywide building stock and will aid the
City in meeting its earthquake resilience goals such as residential shelter-in-
place.
The use of these prescriptive provisions will assist San Francisco building
owners in strengthening buildings by providing a clear set of construction
requirements and by allowing building owners to qualify for assistance from
various seismic improvement programs. Building owners using the prescriptive
provisions will not need to engage the services of a registered design
professional and will generally find that seismic improvement design and
construction costs are reduced compared to engineered retrofits.
SCOPE
It is the intent of the Department of Building Inspection to allow the
application of the provisions of CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3 to residential
buildings of Occupancy Classifications R-3 and R-3.1.
IMPLEMENTATION
Permits seeking to comply with this Administrative Bulletin shall be in
accordance with CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3.
PLAN REVIEW AND PERMIT ISSUANCE
On-line, over-the-counter and other expedited forms of permit issuance shall be
allowed for work that fully complies with CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3.
If proposed work does not conform to all prescriptive requirements or exceeds
the scope of CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3, either over-the-counter plan review or
submittal of permit application shall be required. Submitted applications will
be processed in accordance with standard Department procedures.
PERMIT SUBMITTAL DOCUMENTS
Each building permit application that is submitted to comply with CEBC,
Appendix Chapter A3 must clearly state in the ‚ÄúProject Description‚Äù portion of
the application, ‚ÄúThis Permit is for work to be performed in general

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†approximate length and height along each wall line.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†number of stories above each wall line or portion of wall line.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†approximate percentage of each wall line or portion of wall line
proposed to be braced.
This plan need not be prepared by a licensed design professional provided the
proposed design does not exceed the limitations under state law requiring a
licensed design professional.
Permits that fully comply with A3 shall be issued over-the-counter. Field
inspection by Department staff shall verify that work is done in conformance
with prescriptive requirements.
For Permits that Do Not Conform to all Prescriptive Requirements of CEBC,
Appendix Chapter A3
Submittal documents prepared by a licensed design professional must accompany a
permit application for work that does not conform to all of the prescriptive
requirements of CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3. Such submittal documents must show:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†A plan of the floor(s) or level(s) to be reinforced showing

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†b.¬†¬†¬†number of stories above each wall line or portion of wall line.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†¬†¬†approximate location of proposed bracing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†For cripple walls that are proposed to be braced that are over 4
feet in height in buildings up to two stories, or over 14 inches in height for
three story buildings, a stamped and signed analysis by a registered design
professional or other submittal documentation determined acceptable by the
Department shall be submitted showing that the proposed alternatives are
equivalent to CEBC, Appendix Chapter A3 in strength, deflection and capacity.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†For new or partial foundation construction to be undertaken as part
of the CEBC, Appendix A3 upgrade work, engineered foundation plans meeting the
requirements of the San Francisco Building Code prepared by a registered design
professional shall be submitted.
PLAN REVIEW BY OTHER CITY AGENCIES
Review by agencies other than the Department of Building Inspection shall be in
accordance with standard plan review guidelines.
Specific conditions of permit approval may be required by other City agencies.
Project sponsors should carefully review all comments and notes on plans and
permits regarding such conditions of approval.
FEES
Fees for plan review and permit issuance by all agencies shall be as detailed
in San Francisco codes and regulations.
TRIGGERED CODE REQUIREMENTS

               SFEBC Section 329, created with Ordinance 202-14, mandates the
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬seismic evaluation of certain existing buildings and non-building
               structures used by schools that are not under the jurisdiction of

¬†
Part A. Regulations and Commentary for SFEBC Section 329
Part A of this Bulletin restates the provisions of Section 329 and provides
corresponding interpretations and background commentary. Commentary is shown in
italic font. Section numbers refer to SFEBC Section 329.
Submittal schedule
SFEBC Sections 329.3 and 329.4 provide two submittal deadlines:
The Evaluation Scope document for each school is to be submitted within one
year of the effective date of Section 329.
The Evaluation Report for each school building and non-building structure is to
be submitted within three years of the effective date of Section 329.
Report templates for each submittal are provided as attachments to this
Bulletin.
329.1 General.
The intent of Section 329.1 is to cover certain E-occupancy buildings that are
not under the jurisdiction of the Division of State Architect‚Äôs Structural
safety section and non-building structures accessory to those buildings.
The intent of Section 329.1 is to cover all the buildings and non-building
structures on the school campus that are used primarily for school purposes,
including cafeterias, gyms and multipurpose rooms. Schools will have the
opportunity to use the Scoping Document to state buildings they intend to
evaluate.
For purposes of Section 329, a ‚Äúnon-building structure‚Äù is defined in SFBC
Chapter 2 as a structure that does not support or shelter any use or occupancy
and is also defined in ASCE 7-16 Chapter 15. The intent of Section 329.1 is to
include non-building structures such as retaining walls, covered walkways,
patio covers, and other structures that are prone to earthquake damage, but
only when these non-building structures serve buildings subject to Section 329.
It is not the intent of Section 329.1 to include lightweight structures with no
history of poor earthquake performance, such as well-anchored playground
equipment or light wood or metal fences. Some Department judgment is expected
to apply during review of the Evaluation Scope document.
It is not the intent of Section 329.1 to cover:
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Buildings off of the school‚Äôs campus, even if used by students or faculty.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Buildings on the school‚Äôs campus that are used primarily for non-school
purposes, such as churches or convents, including such buildings occupied by 25
or more persons for less than 12 hours per week or four hours in any given day.
SFBC Section 305.1.1 applies to spaces associated with the functions of the
place of religious worship to which they are accessory. It is the intent of
SFEBC Section 329.1 that classrooms in buildings used for religious worship are
within the scope of Section 329.1 if they are used for educational purposes for
an amount of time that exceeds the time restrictions listed in 329.1 Exception
1.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Buildings occupied by 25 or more persons for less than 12 hours per week or
four hours in any given day.
‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Schools where the average enrollment of the past three years is 25 or fewer
students.
In accordance with SFBC Section 303.1.3, school gyms, auditoriums, and other
spaces or structures used for assembly purposes that are nevertheless assigned
an E occupancy and are thus within the scope of Section 329.1.
Evaluations shall be conducted under the supervision of a licensed design
professional.
329.2 Scope and Criteria
For purposes of Section 329, previous versions of ASCE 41, specifically ASCE
31-03 and ASCE 41-06, are not acceptable as alternatives to ASCE 41-13. See
Part B of this Bulletin for modifications and interpretations of ASCE 41-13
criteria.
¬†
Commentary: The intent of the evaluation is to identify hazards known to be
associated with earthquake-related severe injury or death.
In addition to the tabulated scope, voluntary mitigation of contents hazards is
encouraged. Such mitigation could include bracing, restraint, or removal of
supplies, stored items, or furnishings prone to hazardous tipping or sliding.
It might also include nonstructural mitigation that is not required by Section
329. References regarding contents bracing have been developed by FEMA, the
Division of the State Architect, and others. For example, see ‚ÄúGuide and
Checklist for Nonstructural Earthquake Hazards in California Schools,‚Äù
available at https://mitigation.eeri.org/wp-content/uploads/guide-and-
checklist-for-cal-schools.pdf.
329.5 Voluntary Minimum Life-Safety Retrofit
¬†
Commentary: Section 329 requires evaluation only. Section 329.5, however,
anticipates that some schools will perform voluntary mitigation or retrofit
either before or after completing their evaluation. To encourage this work and
to relieve these schools from unknown future requirements, Section 329.5
provides, for a period of 20 years after the effective date of Section 329,
that any building or non-building structure within the scope of Section 329 for
which voluntary seismic strengthening is performed to meet or exceed the
criteria of ASCE 41-13, S-3 N-C with the BSE-1E hazard shall not be identified
as a seismic hazard pursuant to any local building standards adopted after the
effective date of Section 329 unless the building incurred disproportionate
damage, or otherwise has been damaged or altered so that it no longer meets the
engineering criteria under which it was retrofitted.
Part B. APPLICATION OF ASCE 41-13 TO EVALUATION
Part B of this Bulletin makes modifications to and interpretations of ASCE 41-
13 as they relate to compliance with SFEBC Section 329. The section numbers
refer to section numbers in ASCE 41-13.
1.4 Seismic Evaluation Process
With reference to Figure C1-1, Tier 3 Systematic evaluation is required for
certain buildings, subject to Bulletin modifications to Section 3.3. Where Tier
3 Systematic evaluation is not required, Tier 1 Screening is required for all
evaluations, and Tier 2 Deficiency-Based Evaluation is optional.
1.4.1 Selection of Performance Objective
Omit. The evaluation objective is given in SFEBC Section 329.2.
1.4.2 Level of Seismicity
The level of seismicity shall be taken as High for all schools subject to SFEBC
Section 329.
1.4.4 Evaluation Procedures
Tier 1 Screening is required. Tier 2 Deficiency-Based Evaluation is optional.
Tier 3 Systematic evaluation is not required.
1.4.5 Evaluation Report
Omit. The template report required by ASCE 41 is not to be used in this case.
Evaluation reports should use the attached Template Evaluation Report.
1.5 Seismic Retrofit Process
Omit. Retrofit is beyond the scope of SFEBC Section 329.
2.1 Scope - 2.3 Target Building Performance Levels
Omit. Evaluation objectives are given in SFEBC Section 329.2.
2.4 Seismic Hazard
Per SFEBC Section 329.2, all evaluations are required to consider only the BSE-
1E hazard.
For purposes of compliance with SFEBC Section 329, the Site-Specific Procedure
of Section 2.4.2 need not be used.
2.4.1 General Procedure for Hazard Due to Ground Shaking
Per SFEBC Section 329.2, all evaluations are required to consider only the BSE-
1E hazard.
Seismicity parameters for the BSE-1E hazard may be obtained using the Seismic
Design Maps tool available at https://www.seismicmaps.org/.
For purposes of calculating seismicity parameters with the USGS tool, Site
Class F need not be assumed.
2.4.1.6.1 Site Classes
Where the Site Class is known from available documents, the known Site Class
should be used. Where the Site Class is not known, for purposes of compliance
with SFEBC Section
329, the Site Class may be estimated from the SEAOC Seismic Design Map
available at https://www.seismicmaps.org/.
Unless site-specific investigations indicate otherwise, Site Class F shall be
assumed for any site located within a zone of required investigation for
liquefaction on the 2000 Department of Conservation map available at https://
earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/urban/sfbay/liquefaction/sfbay/.
Otherwise, Site Class F need not be assumed.
For purposes of compliance with SFEBC Section 329, site-specific investigation
of potential Site Class F sites is not required as long as potential
liquefaction is noted on the Deficiency List in the seismic evaluation report.
2.5 Level of Seismicity
The level of seismicity shall be taken as High for all schools subject to SFEBC
Section 329.
3.2.4 Site and Foundation Information
For purposes of compliance with SFEBC Section 329, any requirement in ASCE 41-
13 for site-specific soils or geotechnical investigation is waived. Owners may
perform and report the results of such investigations voluntarily.
3.3.1 Limitations on the Use of the Tier 1 and 2 Evaluation and Retrofit
Procedures
For purposes of compliance with SFEBC Section 329, Tier 3 evaluation is not
required. However, if ASCE 41-13 Section 3.3.1 would require Tier 3 evaluation,
each Tier 1 checklist item subject to that requirement (which in some cases
might be only those on Immediate Occupancy but not Life Safety checklists)
shall be listed in the Deficiency List with a note indicating potential non-
compliance subject to Tier 3 analysis.

TITLE¬†¬†¬†:   Building Fa√ßade Inspection and Maintenance
               The purpose of this Bulletin is to establish policies for implementing San
PURPOSE¬†¬†¬†: Francisco Existing Building Code Chapter 5F regarding building fa√ßade
               inspection and maintenance.
               Current edition of the San Francisco Existing Building Code,

               Code of Federal Regulations, Part 61, Secretary of the Interior‚Äôs Standards
               for the Treatment of Historic Properties
               San Francisco Existing Building Code
               Chapter 5F requires that building fa√ßades undergo initial and subsequent
               inspections according to a schedule based on the original construction date
               of a building. These inspections, as well as reporting and maintenance, are
               to be done as detailed in this Administrative Bulletin and in accordance with
               the San Francisco Existing Building Code (SFEBC). SFEBC Section
               504F.1 directs that the basis for inspection and reporting is the latest
DISCUSSION¬†¬†¬edition of ASTM E2270, Standard Practice for Periodic Inspection of Building
               Facades for Unsafe Conditions, as modified and interpreted by this
               Administrative Bulletin. Facade inspections are primarily to be undertaken to
               identify unsafe conditions that could jeopardize public safety and to
               identify other conditions that could deteriorate into unsafe conditions
               before the next scheduled inspection. The intent of
               Chapter 5F is to verify that fa√ßade elements and systems are maintained such
               that they will perform in accordance with the code under which they were
               installed or improved.
               Certain buildings that are five or more stories and that are of construction
               Type I, II, III, or IV are required to have facade inspection and maintenance
APPLICABILITY: undertaken in accordance with Chapter 5F, Chapter 4, and this Administrative
               Bulletin.
               Buildings of other construction types and number of stories may voluntarily
               apply the provisions of this Administrative Bulletin.
¬†
INSPECTORS
Required fa√ßade inspection and maintenance shall be performed under the direct
supervision of a qualified professional who shall be a California licensed
architect or engineer retained by the property owner, and who shall oversee all
work of qualified inspectors and all reporting.
For inspection of buildings considered to be historic resources, the qualified
professional shall have expertise in structural inspection and maintenance of
historic resources, subject to the approval of the Director. Such expertise
shall consist of documented history of successful projects and/or detailed
investigations of historic structures and preparation of recommendations or
repair documents for the treatment of such properties in order to preserve them
in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior‚Äôs Standards for the Treatment
of Historic Properties.
INSPECTION PROCEDURES
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†For the purpose of meeting the requirements of
Chapter 5F, the provisions of ASTM E2270, Standard Practice for Periodic
Inspection of Building Facades for Unsafe Conditions to be applied shall be
those in the current edition of ASTM E2270 revision of that Standard, as
modified in this Administrative Bulletin.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Prior to inspection, the owner should determine from the Planning
Department if the building qualifies as a ‚Äúhistoric resource.‚Äù Such information
is available on the Planning Department website at http://www.sf-planning.org/
index.aspx?page=1825 or by contacting Planning Department Preservation Program
staff at the Planning Information Center (PIC) at 49 South Van Ness, 2nd Floor,
San Francisco, 628-652-7300, or pic@sfgov.org. If a building is qualified as a
‚Äúhistoric resource,‚Äù special requirements as noted herein shall be applied.
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Special considerations regarding the application of ASTM E2270 include:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Detailed floor plans, construction details, and other detailed
documentation per ASTM E2270, Item 7 are required only as necessary to
undertake inspection or communicate inspection findings to property owner or
Department of Building Inspection staff. Sufficient building plan information
should be assembled to identify areas of inspection, locations or elements
requiring maintenance work, locations of unsafe conditions, and other
inspection findings.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†As part of a general inspection, probes, per ASTM E2270, Item
10.4.8, are not mandatory and need not be undertaken unless considered
necessary by the qualified professional. Inspection should include careful
visual inspection of external indicators of fa√ßade deterioration before probing
or opening to observe concealed fa√ßade components.
¬†¬†¬†D.¬†¬†¬†The qualified professional shall consult with the property owner and/or
building manager regarding any locations of known water leakage or
infiltration. This information may be useful in selecting locations for
detailed inspection and probes.
¬†¬†¬†E.¬†¬†¬†Remote sensing techniques, including 3-D survey, remote aerial
vehicles, and other non-traditional inspection methods that may be proposed by
the qualified professional may be approved by the Director on a case-by-case
basis. All applicable regulations regarding the operation of remote vehicles
and equipment must be followed.
¬†¬†¬†F.¬†¬†¬†Note: Persons conducting building fa√ßade inspections are encouraged to
review ASTM E2841, Standard Guide for Conducting Inspections of Building
Fa√ßades for Unsafe Conditions. That document provides recommended procedures
and methodologies for conducting inspections of building fa√ßades.
SPECIAL FACADE INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS
¬†¬†¬†A.¬†¬†¬†Inspection of Historic Resources
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Assessment and recommendations related to facades of historic
resources shall be performed in conformance with the Secretary of the
Interior‚Äôs Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Inspection methods for historic resources shall use the least
intrusive or invasive means feasible to effectively assess hidden conditions.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†When practical, building materials removed to allow for detailed
inspection shall be salvaged and reinstalled, or stored by the property owner
for future reinstallation.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Qualified historic resources may be evaluated using the provisions
in the California Historical Building Code regarding strength, performance,
utilization, and other properties of archaic materials, provided that such
provisions result in acceptable performance as detailed in the San Francisco
Existing Building Code and in this Administrative Bulletin.
¬†¬†¬†B.¬†¬†¬†Significant Damage
Either during the normal passage of time or following an earthquake, wind storm
or other cause, building facades that appear to exhibit significant damage
require an inspection of the apparently damaged fa√ßade area or elements to be
undertaken within 60 days of discovery of such damage, per
503F.3, in addition to immediate actions required to address Unsafe conditions.
Significant damage includes items that have fallen from a building or items
that have cracked or dislodged to become potential falling hazards.
Determination of such significant damage shall be by an authorized inspector or
other design professional.
¬†¬†¬†C.¬†¬†¬†Waiver of Initial Inspection based on previous inspection and
maintenance work
A request for a waiver of the Initial Inspection due to a previously completed
comprehensive fa√ßade inspection and/or maintenance project, per
Chapter 5F, Section
503F.1, Exception 2, shall include all materials required to be provided to the
Department of Building Inspection in an inspection report as detailed in this
Administrative Bulletin and shall include documentation of the scope of
completed repairs, such as reports, plans and specifications, and building
permits. Special approval of Waivers of Initial Inspection may be approved by
the Director on a case-by-case basis for other reasons, such as for previously
submitted reports or studies, or for work undertaken in previous phases.
NOTIFICATION AND ACTION REGARDING UNSAFE CONDITIONS
If an Unsafe Condition is identified at any time during the fa√ßade inspection
and reporting process, the qualified professional shall immediately notify both
the property owner and the Director of such condition.
If what appears to be an Unsafe Condition is observed by an authorized
inspector or other design professional during the course of a post-earthquake
evaluation or under any other circumstance, such person shall immediately
notify the Director of such apparent condition. The Director shall immediately
arrange to have a qualified professional or other appropriate investigator
evaluate the conditions. If such condition is determined to be Unsafe, the
owner shall be immediately contacted.
Immediate contact with the Director shall be by telephone to the Director at
628-652-3500 or to the Department of Building Inspection Emergency Response 24-
hour Contact at 628-652-3333. Notice shall also be sent by email to
dbi.facade@sfgov.org or by delivery of written notice. In case of emergencies
such as earthquakes, other notification contact methods may be established.
Upon receipt of notification from the inspector of an Unsafe Condition, the
property owner shall, as soon as reasonably possible, take action to protect
the public and property. Such actions may require the owner to coordinate with
various City agencies in the installation of barriers or closure of sidewalks
or streets. For such coordination in emergency mitigation of Unsafe Conditions,
contact:

DISCUSSION:
1.¬†¬†¬†SCOPE OF THIS BULLETIN
This bulletin presents guidelines for developing a geotechnical site-
investigation program and preparing geotechnical reports for foundation design
and construction of tall buildings in San Francisco. Sections 2 and 3 of this
bulletin are requirements and therefore are stated in mandatory language. The
remaining sections are guidelines, which use non-mandatory language.
For the purposes of this bulletin, tall buildings are defined as those with hn
(ASCE 7), greater than 240 feet.
The height, hn, is defined in the San Francisco Building Code (SFBC) as the
height of level n above the average level of the ground surface adjacent to the
structure. Level n is permitted to be taken as the roof of the structure,
excluding mechanical penthouses and other projections above the roof whose mass
is small compared with the mass of the roof.
Early in a project, the Geotechnical Engineer of Record (GEOR) shall develop a
geotechnical site-investigation program and geotechnical report document in
accordance with this bulletin.
2.¬†¬†¬†GEOTECHNICAL DESIGN REVIEW
The review of geotechnical design shall meet the requirements of AB-082. The
geotechnical member(s) of the Engineering Design Review Team (EDRT) shall
participate in the Early Site Permit phase of the project to review the GEOR‚Äôs
plan for geotechnical site investigations and the GEOR‚Äôs geotechnical basis-of-
design document. During the subsequent design review, the EDRT will use the
guidelines below to review the geotechnical report prepared for foundation
design and construction.
At the conclusion of the review, the geotechnical members of the EDRT shall
provide a written statement that, in their professional opinion, the
geotechnical site-investigation plan and geotechnical reports meet the
requirements of the SFBC and this bulletin.
¬†
Commentary: The Draft of this bulletin was developed by a volunteer group of
experienced geotechnical engineers as an ad-hoc committee of the Structural
Engineers Association of Northern California (SEAONC). The draft was requested
of SEAONC by SFDBI. Subsequently, the draft of this bulletin was processed (and
in some places revised) through subcommittees of the Building Inspection
Commission according to the Administrative Bulletin process.
¬†
3.¬†¬†¬†SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
Project submittal documents shall be in accordance with the SFBC and Department
of Building Inspection (DBI) interpretations, Administrative Bulletins, and
policies. In addition, documents relevant to the Geotechnical Design Review
shall be submitted by the Engineer of Record to the Director and to the
geotechnical members of the EDRT.
4.¬†¬†¬†PROJECT DEFINITION AND DESIGN CRITERIA
In coordination with the project architect and structural engineer, the
following information (if available at the time of preparation of the
geotechnical report) should be provided: The project description; a site
location map; height of the structure; number of stories; number of basement
levels; lateral and gravity loads resisting systems; anticipated gravity
foundation loads or bearing pressures; applicable codes and design guidelines
for seismic design of the building (e.g., PEER TBI 2017 performance-based
design of tall buildings); description of the energy dissipation system (if
used); and the approach for development of design ground motions.
5.¬†¬†¬†SITE SURFACE CONDITIONS
Description of existing structure(s) on the site should be presented with
information related to the foundations (if known); the site‚Äôs historical and
current use; site surface elevation including, the reference datum; and
description of adjacent facilities and structures with information related to
their foundation system (if known) within the foundation zone of influence. The
GEOR should determine the foundation zone of influence based on site‚Äôs
subsurface conditions, foundation type, and building configuration.
¬†
Commentary: For a mat foundation bearing on the Colma sand layer, the lateral
extent of the zone of influence could be estimated as approximately ¬Ω of
distance between the base of the mat and bedrock.
6.¬†¬†¬†REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY
This section should include a description of regional and local geology,
including fill placement as part of land reclamation, if any. The description
of local site geology should provide information about the anticipated
engineering soil and rock properties likely to be encountered. Hazard maps and
information from the USGS and the State should also be presented including
anticipated sea level rise during the design life of the structure (e.g., NRC
2012, CCSF 2014, and CCSF 2016), seismic ground motion, soil liquefaction and
lateral spreading, landslides, and tsunami/seiche (for sites near the
shoreline).
7.¬†¬†¬†SEISMICITY
A fault map should be provided showing the location of Holocene active faults
within a 100 km radius of the site, with the epicenter and magnitude of
historical earthquake events shown on the map. A table should be provided
containing the pertinent fault information for sources that contribute
significantly to the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) performed for
a return period of 2,475 years at the key periods of interest to the building
design using Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF) fault data
file.
¬†
Commentary: The version of UCERF fault data file that is referenced by the
latest California Building Code (CBC)/SFBC and ASCE 7 Standard should be
identified and used. In current practice, when performing deterministic seismic
hazards analysis (DSHA), maximum fault magnitudes are obtained either from
UCERF2 fault data file or mean/mode magnitude from deaggregation of 2,475-year
PSHA results.
8.¬†¬†¬†FIELD INVESTIGATION AND LABORATORY TESTING
The subsurface conditions should be explored by drilling borings, and if
appropriate, conducting cone penetration test (CPT) soundings. When considering
the plan area of the proposed development and the magnitude of building loads,
the number of borings and CPTs should be sufficient for characterizing the
site‚Äôs subsurface conditions and physical properties of soils and bedrock
encountered.
The quality of samples should be appropriate for the anticipated laboratory
strength or compressibility tests conducted to obtain load-deformation
characteristics of soil in support of advanced numerical modeling.
¬†
Commentary: Integrated field and laboratory tests should be performed as
appropriate to support the anticipated methods of analysis, which commonly
include standard general limit equilibrium (GLE) methods and 2D or 3D nonlinear
seismic soil-structure interaction (SSI) analyses. Historically, the selection
of soil properties for static and seismic design of building foundations has
been accomplished through parameter correlations with field tests such as the
CPT and field vane shear test (FVST). Correlations with the results of field
and soil-index tests are useful; however, it is recommended that relationships
used in support of tall-building design in San Francisco be checked against
local geotechnical data and adjusted, if need be, to provide representative
properties of local soils. With the evolution and widespread adoption of
performance-based seismic design for tall buildings, advanced numerical
analyses incorporating soil-structure interaction (SSI) may be performed.
Appropriate SSI analyses require substantial characterization of soil behavior
such as strain-dependent shear modulus and material damping curves, and
residual shear strength. The use of field test data should be supplemented with
laboratory tests that provide soil parameters across the range of deformation
anticipated for the project. Strain-dependent soil parameters must also account
for the rate effects and the potential for cyclic degradation of soil stiffness
and strength. Laboratory tests on soil, such as cyclic direct simple shear and
cyclic triaxial, can provide insight into the soil behavior during seismic
loading. The integration of suitability extensive field and laboratory test
programs improves the reliability of site characterization, thereby reducing
uncertainty.
¬†
Information and data from existing geotechnical borings and CPTs could be used
to supplement new borings as long as existing geotechnical borings and CPTs are
located reasonably close to the project site and are drilled in accordance with
currently acceptable methods and standards. However, borings drilled only for
environmental soil and/or groundwater sampling and testing or for water wells
should not be used as a substitute for project-specific geotechnical borings or
CPTs.
For sites with depth-to-bedrock of more than 100 feet, at least one boring
should extend a minimum of 50 feet below the surface of bedrock; other borings
should be as deep as deemed appropriate as determined by the GEOR and reviewed
by the geotechnical members of the EDRT, based on the site‚Äôs subsurface
conditions, structural loads, and below-grade structural geometry.
For depth-to-bedrock of less than 100 feet, all borings should extend to the
bedrock surface with one boring extending at least 50 feet below bedrock
surface.
If used, CPTs should be pushed to refusal using a 20-ton CPT rig, if it is
possible to access the site with it. At least one CPT sounding should be near a
geotechnical boring for calibration purposes. If site conditions prohibit
access for a CPT rig within the site, additional CPTs and/or borings adjacent
to the site may be necessary and may be required by the EDRT.
¬†
Commentary: Field vane shear tests (FVST) are useful for evaluating the peak
and remolded undrained shear strength of soft clay. For evaluation of soil
liquefaction potential, lateral spreading, and slope instability adjacent to
the site, it is suggested that CPT soundings be performed as much as practical
because they provide continuous, reliable measurements that can be correlated
to physical soil properties. CPTs are also useful for characterizing denser and
stiffer units, such as Old Bay Clay (OBC) and for characterizing groundwater
conditions with a pore pressure dissipation test. However, because liquefiable
and soft soils are bypassed by using deep foundations or by using ground
improvement to provide appropriate bearing support for building foundation, CPT
soundings are of limited use under the building footprint because CPTs will
most likely encounter refusal within the dense sand layer present at many sites
in San Francisco. A sufficient number of borings should be drilled for adequate
sampling within the OBC layer. Typically, at least one boring should be drilled
or one CPT sounding should be performed in every 5,000 square feet of plot
area.
¬†
Shear-wave velocity should be measured at least at one location using downhole
techniques, seismic CPT, suspension logging, or surface-wave method, as
appropriate. The number of tests should reflect the lateral variability of the
soil deposits across the site. The shear-wave-velocity measurement should be
conducted in such a manner as to allow for accurate determination of variation
of shear-wave velocity with depth for computing the Vs30 parameter and for
conducting site response analysis (if performed). If downhole logging is used,
the shear-wave velocity of bedrock should be measured within the boring that
extends at least 50 feet below the surface of bedrock.
To capture the variability in groundwater conditions over time, at least one
piezometer should be installed, and piezometric levels should be observed from
the time of original geotechnical exploration. In some cases, additional
piezometers may be necessary and may be required by the EDRT.
Soil borings should be drilled using rotary wash drilling methods (unless the
groundwater table is below the bottom of the boring). Drilling fluid or casing
should be used to prevent collapse of borings and bottom instability.
Where compressibility and strength tests are planned in soft clays (e.g., Bay
mud - BM), samples should be obtained using a thin-walled tube sampler.
¬†
Commentary: Osterberg-type hydraulic fixed-piston sampler with thin-wall tubes
of constant inside diameter can provide high-quality samples.
¬†
In stiff clays (e.g., OBC) where strength and consolidation tests are planned,
Pitcher Barrel sampler or approved equivalent should be used.
Standard penetration tests (SPT) should be performed in cohesionless soils.
California modified sampler or Sprague and Henwood (S&H) sampler may be used in
the alluvium often found between the bottom of OBC and bedrock and where
strength and compressibility tests are not required. Hammer energy measurements
should be performed for drive sample system (e.g., SPT and S&H) on at least one
boring for the project.
¬†
Commentary: Pressuremeter test results have been successfully correlated with
large strain modulus of various geological units in the east coast of the
United States and overseas.
¬†
Rock coring should be used to obtain rock cores within bedrock for borings that
extend at least 50 feet into rock. Rock cores should be reviewed and classified
by a registered professional geologist. Parameters defining degree of rock
weathering, rock strength, rock hardness, and rock mass properties such as the
RQD, spacing of discontinuities, conditions of discontinuities, and dip angle
should be recorded as directed by the GEOR.
For all soil types, sample intervals should be no greater than 5 feet or at
layer interface unless a larger interval is deemed appropriate by the GEOR
based on thickness and uniformity of soil layer, data from field vane tests or
CPT soundings.
For sandy soils, one or more of the following laboratory tests, as deemed
appropriate by GEOR, should be conducted: moisture-density (if S&H sampler is
used), moisture test (if SPT sampler is used), fines content (minus sieve No.
200), sieve analysis, and plastic and liquid limits (if silty or clayey sand).
For cohesive soils, one or more of the following tests, as deemed appropriate
by the GEOR, should be conducted: (1) unconsolidated or consolidated undrained
triaxial tests, or (2) a direct simple shear test. Unconfined compressive
strength may be used on representative rock samples but should not be used for
cohesive soils.
The GEOR should determine the adequate number of pairs of consolidation and
undrained shear strength tests to be performed on undisturbed samples of OBC
for evaluation of settlement if a mat foundation is not supported by a deep
foundation and is placed above the surface of OBC or if the foundation bears
above or within OBC. One pair of consolidation and undrained shear strength
tests should be considered for every 30 feet of OBC depth in four
representative borings, unless the variability of the site is evaluated through
CPTs. The minimum number of pairs should be four. Additional tests would be
required if the preconsolidation stress is exceeded.
If OBC is expected to be subjected to vertical effective stresses higher than
the preconsolidation pressure, additional tests are also required to measure
the secondary consolidation characteristics of the OBC.
Field ‚Äúindex‚Äù tests such as the Pocket Penetrometer or Torvane tests may be
used on clayey soil samples but should not be considered as a substitute for
any laboratory tests described above.
9.¬†¬†¬†SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS
At least two perpendicular cross sections should be provided. A full
description of soil layers and geologic units with engineering properties
(consistency and consolidation characteristic for clayey soils and potential
for soil liquefaction and settlement for sand layers) should be provided.
A design groundwater elevation with consideration of sea level rise during the
design life of the structure and seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level (if
known) should be presented. The groundwater table expected to be encountered
during construction should also be identified.
¬†
Commentary: The GEOR should use her/his judgement as to how far inland the
influence of sea level rise would impact the groundwater level.
¬†
10.¬†¬†¬†FOUNDATION AND GEOTECHNICAL EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING STUDIES
10.1¬†¬†¬†Code-Based Site Classification
The Site Class designation should be made following the current edition of the
applicable code and standard (e.g., ASCE 7, SFBC). The Site Class definitions
should be based on Vs30 and presence of soft clay or liquefiable soils.
According to the code-based Site Class designation, Vs30 is defined in the free
field from the ground surface to the depth of 30 m (100 ft). However, Site
Class may be defined below the bottom of the mat foundation (see Section 10.2.2
Ground Motion Characterization Commentary), if deemed appropriate.
10.2¬†¬†¬†Ground Motion and Seismic Ground Deformation Characterization
The regional seismic hazard assessment and ground-motion characterization
should follow the procedures provided in applicable seismic guidelines and code
provisions (e.g., PEER TBI 2017, ASCE 7). These procedures include the
application of Probabilistic and Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA,
DSHA) incorporating specific seismic source models (e.g., UCERF, USGS NSHMP
2014 or 2018) and ground motion models (GMMs). The GEOR may use updated, widely
adopted models in PSHA and DSHA in site-specific analysis. The ground-motion
characterization should address pertinent issues such as near-fault effects,
basin effects, and dynamic soil response (site effects). Embedment and base
averaging effects may be accounted for, as applicable.
The selection and modification of ground motions (acceleration time series)
should be consistent with recommendations found in the applicable codes and
standards.
The subsequent sections address ground-motion characterization at the surface
and at depth.
10.2.1¬†¬†¬†Ground-Motion Characterization at Surface
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For Site Classes A, B, and C, the ground-motion development may be based
on Vs30 measured from the ground surface using ground motion models (GMMs). The
resulting ground-surface acceleration response spectra (MCER and DE) should be
checked against minimum code requirements.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For Site Class D determined based on Vs30 measured from the ground
surface, the ground motion may be developed using site response analyses or
GMM‚Äôs, as determined by the GEOR and approved by the geotechnical members of
the EDRT. The resulting acceleration response spectra should be checked against
the minimum code requirements. Consideration of site response analysis is
warranted because of the breadth of the Vs30 values defining Site Class D soil
profiles (i.e., Vs30 of 600 to 1,200 ft/sec) and the range in anticipated
ground-surface motions for the wide variety of soil conditions represented by
Site Class D sites.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Other factors influencing the decision to perform a site response
analysis include: (1) depth to material with shear wave velocity equal to or
greater than 1,200 ft/s, (2) depth to bedrock defined as the Site Class B/
C boundary (2,500 ft/sec), and (3) the trend of site-specific Vs with depth
(i.e., the site period).
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For Site Classes E and F, site response analysis using methods suitably
calibrated by the GEOR should be performed and the design spectrum calculated
at the ground surface should be in conformance with the applicable Building
Code requirements. For sites where (1) surficial soil (e.g., liquefiable fill
and soft Bay mud) are removed through basement excavation and foundation
installation or (2) ground improvement is used to bypass liquefiable or soft
soil, the GEOR should evaluate whether the site could be reclassified as site
class D with concurrence with the geotechnical members of the EDRT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The number and characteristics of ground motions, variation in shear-wave
velocity profile, and variation in soil shear modulus reduction and material
damping curves used in site response analysis should be adequate to capture the
potential variation in surface ground motion in a realistic and defensible
manner.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The following procedure is suggested for consideration by the GEOR:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†After a thorough review of site-specific geotechnical and geophysical
data, evaluate the applicability of GMMs (i.e., Vs30-based estimation) for
approximating the dynamic response of the soil profile.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†If site-specific aspects of the soil profile are not reasonably
approximated by the ‚Äúaverage, characteristic Vs profile‚Äù implied by the GMMs,
ground response analysis should be considered. The ground-surface motions
developed through ground response analysis should be checked against minimum
code requirements.
¬†
Ground Motion Characterization Commentary: The level of analysis required for
establishing surface, or near-surface, ground motions should reflect site-
specific factors such as stratigraphy, geotechnical characteristics and
properties of the soils, depth to bedrock, the trend of Vs from the ground
surface to competent bedrock, and the amplitude of the bedrock motions (e.g.,
MCER, DE). Methods of analysis can be generalized as consisting of (1)
numerical dynamic site response analyses, (2) estimation using current GMMs
that include regression terms for Vs30 (e.g., NGA-West2 GMMs), and (3)
simplified, code-based site class designation and site coefficients (Fpga, Fa,
and Fv), which are required as a check on the ground motions developed using
methods 1 or 2. The applicability and suitability of site response analysis and
GMMs for the development of design-level ground surface motions should be
evaluated prior to adoption on a project-specific basis for all Class D sites.
The potential range of representative ground-surface motions anticipated at
Class D sites due to the inherent variability of subsurface conditions and
dynamic response of soil profiles falling under this general Vs30-based
classification in the San Francisco Bay Area necessitates critical evaluation
of the procedures applied for developing design ground motions. It is suggested
that the GEOR engage the geotechnical members of the EDRT as soon as practical
after pertinent site-specific geotechnical and geophysical data have been
collected to identify the appropriate method of developing ground-surface
motions prior to analysis. The following suggestions are deemed pertinent to
local practice and provided for demonstration and guidance.
For sites containing soft-to-medium stiff fine-grained soils (e.g., BM),
numerical ground response analysis is preferred and considered the primary
method for developing ground-surface motions. This suggestion also applies to
sites with lower Vs30 (600 ft/s to 900 ft/s). In this situation, methods 2 and
3 are performed as checks on the results of the numerical site response
analyses.
For stiffer soil profiles with Vs30 in the upper range of the Site Class D
category (900 ft/s to 1,200 ft/s), methods 2 and 3 may be acceptable for
characterizing ground motion.
Many sites in the San Francisco Bay Area are underlain by dense sand and stiff
clays that contribute to Vs30 values in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 ft/s. The
development of ground motion for these sites may be based on site-specific Vs30
measured from the ground surface using GMMs.
¬†
¬†
Ground Response Commentary: Dynamic ground response analyses are routinely
performed in practice using equivalent-linear and nonlinear models. The
strengths and limitations of both methods of analysis have been addressed in
the technical literature, and one of the primary differences in the two
approaches is simulation of moderate- to large-strain behavior in cyclic
loading. The combination of soft or medium stiff soil (i.e. BM or other marine
deposits) and liquefiable sands that are prevalent in San Francisco, and the
strength of design-level cyclic loading leads to highly nonlinear soil
behavior. Therefore, nonlinear models that have been suitably calibrated are
preferred over the equivalent linear model; however, equivalent linear site
response analysis results are often used for comparison with nonlinear site
response analysis results. Numerous computer programs have been used to perform
nonlinear site response analysis on local projects. The GEOR may select the
preferred model for the project. It is suggested that the GEOR provide
documentation supporting calibration of the proposed model for analysis of
similar soil profiles subjected to ground motions that are similar in nature to
the design-level motions required for the project. Irrespective of the model
used on the project, the results of the dynamic response analysis should be
reviewed by the geotechnical members of the EDRT.
The slope of bedrock in the vicinity of the site should be evaluated and the
GEOR, with approval from geotechnical members of the EDRT, should determine
whether a two-dimensional site response analysis is required.
¬†
¬†
For sites at which lateral and vertical variability of the soil profile and
depth to bedrock is significant enough to result in dual Site Class
designations, two-dimensional or three-dimensional site response analysis may
be required to develop an appropriate ground motions for design. The required
check against code-based ground motions should be provided for both Site
Classes, and the proposed design motions presented to the geotechnical members
of the EDRT for review.
¬†
10.2.2¬†¬†¬†Site Response and Ground Motion Characterization at Depth of Interest
Time series selected and modified by the GEOR for use in structural dynamic
analyses by the structural engineer of record (SEOR) should be representative
of the ground motions at the depth of interest for the structural model. The
depth of interest is a function of the modeling approach implemented by the
SEOR. Primary considerations for the ground motions used in dynamic structural
analyses are well presented in numerous documents (e.g., NEHRP 2015, NIST 2011,
NIST 2012). In most cases, ground surface motions should not be used in
structural models for buildings with multiple basement levels. Therefore, the
acceleration response spectrum used as the basis for modification of time
series should be developed using either (1) calibrated ground response analysis
allowing development of the acceleration response spectrum at the appropriate
depth, or (2) validated simplified methods that account for foundation
embedment effects. The latter would be required, for example, on projects for
which the ground surface motions were developed using GMM‚Äôs and trends in the
motions with depth are not provided.
The design team, with review by the geotechnical members of the EDRT, should
determine whether ground response analysis should be performed using ground
motions corresponding to MCER, DE (or both), and possibly the Serviceability
Level earthquake (SLE).
For sites where (1) surficial soils (e.g., liquefiable fill and BM) are removed
through basement excavation or foundation installation, or (2) ground
improvement is used to bypass liquefiable and soft soil, the GEOR, with
concurrence of the geotechnical members of the EDRT, should evaluate whether
the site could be reclassified for the sake of ground-motion comparison to
code-based requirements based on a representative 30 m (100 ft) time-averaged
interval velocity that is computed using site-specific Vs data over a depth
range deemed appropriate for configuration of the basement, foundation, or
ground treatment.
¬†
Ground Motion Characterization Commentary: For a surface foundation, the energy
transmitted to the structure is applied through soil in contact with the base
of the foundation. For embedded structures, the basement walls may be in
contact with liquefiable soil or soft clayey soil over a certain depth and then
in contact with competent soil down to the lowest elevation of the basement
walls. In this case, the presence of soft or liquefiable soil may be ignored
and Vs30 could be evaluated from the surface of competent soils. The rationale
behind this is; while ground motion within soft or liquefiable soil may be
higher than ground motion within the competent soils, the energy transmitted to
the structure from these layers is relatively small due to their low stiffness
(i.e., the product of ground-motion intensity and soil stiffness controls the
amount of energy transmitted to the structure from each layer). However,
seismic earth pressures should consider the effects of soft soil against
basement walls.
¬†
10.2.3¬†¬†¬†Kinematic Soil-Structure Interaction (KSSI)
KSSI analysis may be performed using (1) simplified methods accounting for base
averaging and embedment effects (e.g., NIST 2012), or (2) finite element or
finite difference kinematic SSI analysis. It should be noted that the
provisions of ASCE 7-16 (Chapter 19) provide a maximum allowable reduction of
ground motion due to combined (base averaging and embedment) kinematic SSI
effects when performing nonlinear response history analyses. Per ASCE 7-16
Section (19.2.3), the site-specific response spectrum modified for kinematic
SSI shall not be less than 70% of Sa as determined from the design response
spectrum and MCER response spectrum motions developed using the code-based
approaches. When using the simplified method (Chapter 19, ASCE7-16) for
evaluation of ground motion with embedment effects, the Vs30 computed from the
ground surface (as opposed to from the bottom of the basement) should be used.
To compute the ground motion reduction due to embedment effects, the average
shear wave velocity over the height of the basement should be used.
If finite element or finite difference kinematic SSI analysis is performed (1)
the ground motion near the boundary of the model should be similar to those
obtained from one dimensional site response analysis, and (2) kinematic ground
motion should meet ASCE 7 requirements.
¬†
Commentary: If soil conditions at the boundary of the FEM model vary from those
at the site, the ground motion calculated at the boundary may be compared with
results of one-dimensional finite element or finite difference site response
analysis using soil profile at the boundary.
¬†
10.2.4¬†¬†¬†Development of Ground Motion Time Series
If ground acceleration time series are used (i.e., performance-based design
approach), seed motions should be selected based on the controlling earthquake
scenarios (e.g., magnitude, site-to-source distance, significant duration (D5-
75, D5-95), Arias Intensity, peak ground velocity (PGV), and period of pulse
for forward-directivity motions), and the Vs30 at the recording station. The
percentage of seed motions that have near-source (directivity) characteristics
can be defined from deaggregation of the regional seismic hazard (PSHA) for the
2,475-year average return period and across the structural period range of
interest, identification of the primary seismic hazards, and the amplitude of
the motions from the predominate seismic sources relative to the uniform hazard
(NEHRP 2015, NIST 2011).
If spectral matching of seed motions is performed, care should be exercised not
to eliminate or unreasonably elongate the pulse period.
Ground motions with velocity pulse characteristics should be rotated and
oriented along fault normal (FN) and fault parallel (FP) directions.
Furthermore, the modified motions in FN and FP directions should be rotated
again based on the orientation of the building axis relative to the causative
fault. Seed motions that do not exhibit near-fault effects (i.e., without the
forward-directivity or fling step) may be used in a random orientation.
¬†
Commentary: Applying seed motions that do not exhibit near-source effects in a
random orientation deviates from ASCE 7 requirements but is judged to be
appropriate. However, care should be taken that the mean spectra for each
direction of response meets ASCE limits so as to avoid design that do not meet
minimum strength criteria in any direction.
¬†
It is recommended that orbit plots at structural periods of interest be made
before and after spectral matching and before and after rotation of ground
motion along the building axis to confirm that the appropriate orientation of
ground motion is used in the structural dynamic analysis.
For structures on continuous foundations with plan dimensions of greater than
400 feet, effects of wave passage and incoherency of ground motion on design
ground motions should be evaluated and addressed.
10.2.5¬†¬†¬†Seismic Slope Stability and Soil Liquefaction Hazards
The potential for and consequences of liquefaction or cyclic degradation of
soils should be evaluated using current and widely adopted methods of analysis.
The evaluation of liquefaction hazard should be based on standard semi-
empirical methods.
If potentially liquefiable soil layers are present below the foundation level,
the effects of soil liquefaction (strength loss, settlement and down-drag loads
acting on deep foundations) and potential for lateral spreading should be
evaluated. The GEOR should review published maps and reports regarding
potential for soil-liquefaction-induced ground settlement and lateral spreading
at the site and in its vicinity.
¬†
Commentary: Existing reports include Lawson Report on the 1906 Great San
Francisco Earthquake (1908), Harding Lawson Associates, City and County of San
Francisco Soil Liquefaction Report (1992), GHD-GTC Port of San Francisco
Seawall Stability Report (2016), and Port of San Francisco, Seawall Resiliency
Study currently underway.
¬†
For sites underlain by BM, the potential for seismically induced slope
deformation should be evaluated, and mitigation measures should be identified.
10.3¬†¬†¬†Settlement Analysis
Settlement calculations should account for various stages and durations of
construction (i.e., estimates of the time required for each stage of dewatering
and construction should be made). Stages include, but are not limited to,
placement of shoring, dewatering, excavation for construction of basement and
foundation, termination of dewatering, and long-term recharge of groundwater
table. In some cases, and depending on soil permeability, recharging of the
groundwater table may not occur until sometime after completion of
construction. This delay in groundwater recharge should be accounted for when
evaluating the hydrostatic uplift pressure during and after termination of
dewatering (i.e., accounting for full and immediate groundwater recharge after
termination of dewatering may be unconservative). The geotechnical report
should state the estimated long-term groundwater conditions at the site.
10.3.1¬†¬†¬†Shallow Foundations
Short-term and long-term (consolidation) settlement analysis should be
performed using appropriate models as approved by the geotechnical members of
the EDRT.
¬†
Commentary: For shallow foundations, consolidation analysis may be conducted
using computer programs that perform one-dimensional settlement analyses at
several locations across the building footprint and within the zone of
influence based on a three-dimensional stress distribution.
¬†
10.3.2¬†¬†¬†Deep Foundations
For deep foundations that terminate above bedrock, short-term and long-term
(consolidation) settlement analysis should be performed using appropriate
models capable of modeling deep foundations as single piles or pile groups, as
reviewed by the geotechnical members of the EDRT.
¬†
Commentary: Finite-element or finite-difference computer programs, which are
capable of modeling single piles or pile groups, should be used to calculate
consolidation settlement of structures supported on deep foundations.
¬†
10.4¬†¬†¬†Sea Level Rise
The effects of sea level rise during the design life of structures should be
evaluated based on NRC 2012; CCSF 2014; CCSF 2016; Plane et al. 2019; Yasuhara,
et al. 2007; and others. Effects considered should include, but are not limited
to, the potential for increased flooding and the effect of rising groundwater
on increasing hydrostatic pressure, increasing liquefaction potential,
saltwater intrusion, and decreasing bearing capacity.
10.5¬†¬†¬†Static and Seismic Design of Basement Walls
Basement walls should be designed against the more critical of the following
conditions: (1) At-rest soil pressure and (2) active soil pressure plus dynamic
increment. In addition, effects of surcharge loads (traffic and adjacent
building foundation, if not underpinned) should be considered.
When calculating hydrostatic pressure, the design groundwater table with
consideration of sea level rise and seasonal fluctuation of groundwater table
should be identified and used. If a drainage system is not installed behind the
basement walls above the design groundwater table, the basement walls should be
waterproofed beginning at the ground surface. In this case, the basement walls
should be designed per code requirements and checked for the groundwater table
being at the ground surface, but using a load factor of 1.0 as opposed to 1.6
for this check.
¬†
Commentary: According to the load combination in current building code, a
factor of 1.6 is applied to hydrostatic pressure. The resulting pressure in
most cases accounts for effects of sea level rise, fluctuation in groundwater
table, or effects of a temporary buildup of water behind the basement walls due
to a possible breakage in a water conveying pipe adjacent to the site. Care
should be exercised to avoid undue conservatism in design against hydrostatic
pressure.
¬†
Resistance to lateral loads could be calculated by considering frictional
resistance on basement walls and beneath the foundation (if not pile-supported)
and passive pressure against the basement walls, pile caps, grade beams, and
foundation edge extending below the basement walls. In calculating frictional
resistance, the effects of the presence of a waterproofing membrane (if used)
on allowable frictional resistance should be accounted for.
A load-deflection curve for passive resistance should be developed by the GEOR
and used by the SEOR to account for displacement compatibility within various
components contributing to lateral resistance.
For basement walls in contact with slopping ground conditions, the effects of
unbalanced soil pressure on basement walls should be considered.
11.¬†¬†¬†FOUNDATION SUPPORT
Shallow or deep foundation systems may be appropriate for support of tall
buildings depending on the ground conditions, structural loads, and performance
criteria. Unless it could be demonstrated through comprehensive geotechnical
and structural studies that the computed total and differential settlement will
not compromise the safety and functionality of the structure and its
components, foundation systems should be designed to meet the following
criteria using the best estimate soil properties: (1) the total short-term and
long-term computed settlement of the foundation under gravity and seismic loads
should not exceed 4 inches, and (2) its differential settlement under gravity
and seismic loads should not exceed an angular distortion of 1/500.
Nonstructural components such as cladding or partition walls may control the
acceptable threshold of differential settlement. The amount of dishing of the
site under building load should be communicated to the SEOR in the geotechnical
report, so that the appropriate building camber could be provided.
¬†
Commentary: The inherent variability of natural soil deposits often causes
tilting of the foundation (rigid body rotation), which would add to
differential settlement (dishing) caused by the applied structural loads. The
magnitude of foundation tilting is directly related to the extent of total
settlement. Some tilting can be compensated for during construction; however,
some tilting may occur after construction is completed. If settlement of more
than 4 inches is calculated, GEOR and SEOR should work together and carefully
evaluate the impact of settlement larger than 4 inches on the structural system
and nonstructural components. Factors to be considered include the amount of
settlement occurring after placement of the mat and before the lowest floor is
constructed, the timing of placement of cladding and ability to correct
foundation tilting before cladding is installed, and of course, the tolerance
of cladding to differential settlement caused by tilting and/or by dishing of
the mat foundation.
Settlement analyses are often made using the approximation that the foundation
soil deposits are uniform, homogeneous layers. If this simplification is
adopted, it is recommended that the GEOR perform analyses to evaluate the
sensitivity of the computed settlement on the input soil parameters.
¬†
For shallow foundations, the factor of safety against bearing failure (both
global failure mechanism and punching shear failure mechanism) should be
evaluated. A minimum factor of safety of 2.0 should be maintained under
anticipated gravity loads considering the above bearing failure mechanisms.
If ground improvement is used to mitigate the effects of compressible, weak,
liquefiable, or other problematic soil conditions, the GEOR should review
design calculations by the design-build (DB) contractor to check that the
integrity of ground improvement elements is maintained during both static and
seismic loading conditions; that is to say, the replacement ratio and geometry
of grid pattern should be such that the ground improvement system maintains its
integrity under structural gravity loads, seismic loads (base shear and
overturning moment applied by the structure), and seismic loads due to vertical
propagation of seismic waves.
¬†
Commentary: Recent research indicates that individual columns of deep soil mix
(DSM) would bend during design-level ground shaking, thereby limiting the
effectiveness of DSM columns for prevention of soil liquefaction. In addition
to lateral movement, individual unreinforced DSM columns could crack in bending
and with excessive repeated loading and extensive cracking, could have the
effect of losing the cohesive strength associated with cementation, with a
residual strength related to contact through friction only. Unreinforced
individual columns of DSM are brittle and could fail to transfer gravity loads
to more competent soils at depth.
¬†
If deep foundations are used to bypass compressible, soft, or liquefiable
soils, the following construction design issues should be addressed:
11.1 ¬†¬†¬†Driven Concrete and Steel Piles
The geotechnical report should address axial and lateral pile capacity, driving
criteria, noise and vibration effects, corrosion protection, indicator-pile
driving program, and pile load testing.
11.2¬†¬†¬†Augered Cast-in-Place Piles
The geotechnical report should address axial and lateral pile capacity,
integrity testing requirements (especially in case of loose to medium dense
saturated sandy soils and soft clayey soils) using, for example, cross hole
sonic logging, cross hole Gamma-Gamma logging, thermal testing, or a
combination of these methods, as appropriate, pile load testing, and
requirements for an automated data-acquisition system.
11.3¬†¬†¬†Drilled Shafts
The geotechnical report should address axial and lateral pile capacity, axial
pile load test for drilled shafts with reaction piles or bidirectional load
cells, integrity testing using cross-hole sonic logging, cross-hole Gamma-Gamma
logging, thermal testing, or a combination of these methods, as appropriate.
End bearing for shafts is normally ignored unless pile capacity can be verified
by top-down or by using bidirectional load tests. For end bearing in dense sand
or bedrock, the bottom of a shaft should be cleaned out thoroughly and tested
using Mini SID (Shaft Identification Device) or similar tools for evaluating
proper clean out.
12.¬†¬†¬†SHORING, DEWATERING, EXCAVATION AND UNDERPINNING
The geotechnical report should address shoring, dewatering, and underpinning.
Design of the shoring, dewatering, and underpinning system is usually provided
by specialty contractors, with design parameters (soil and groundwater
pressure) provided by the GEOR. If shoring is used to support an adjacent
building, the design soil pressure should correspond to the at-rest pressure
and account for building surcharge. The GEOR and the EDRT should review the
contractor‚Äôs analysis and design to evaluate that the design has used
appropriate soil and groundwater pressures. The GEOR and the EDRT should also
review the contractor‚Äôs Plan of Action for trigger levels (e.g., Warning Level
or Design Limit) of lateral and vertical movement of the shoring and
underpinning system before the start of construction.
Because of the potential presence of confined aquifers within or below the BM
and OBC, nested piezometers should be installed outside of the excavation for
monitoring of drop in groundwater table and water head within various sand
layers, as appropriate.
Bottom of excavation should be evaluated for expected conditions for stability.
If cohesionless soil is exposed at the bottom of the excavation, the factor of
safety against bottom instability should be calculated to check that piping
(quick sand condition) is prevented. If cohesive soil is exposed at bottom of
excavation, the factor of safety against basal heave should be calculated.
Finally, if a cohesionless soil layer at depth is overlain by a layer of
cohesive soil at the bottom of excavation, the blowout condition should be
carefully analyzed and, if necessary, the cohesionless soil layer should be
depressurized to prevent a bottom blowout condition.
13.¬†¬†¬†INSTRUMENTATION AND CONSTRUCTION MONITORING
The GEOR should provide recommendation for geotechnical instrumentation and
construction monitoring at locations where ground conditions, type of loading,
or proximity of existing structures could be adversely affected by planned
construction.
13.1¬†¬†¬†Selection of Instrumentation and Monitoring Requirements
The type, location, and requirements for instrumentation should be determined
by the GEOR based on the impact of construction related to excavation, shoring,
dewatering, foundation installation including noise and vibration, and
implementation of ground improvement on groundwater conditions and performance
of adjacent structures, roadways, utilities, and other improvements.
The geotechnical report should provide the rationale for selection of
instrumentation type and number, installation method, and the frequency of
monitoring for each type of instrumentation.
The frequency of monitoring should be defined based on the type of loading and
construction activities. Monitoring should be initiated before the construction
work starts to obtain ambient or baseline conditions. As appropriate,
monitoring rates may be adjusted after initial period of monitoring, if data
from instrumentations indicate that the rate of change is diminishing with
time.
The instrumentation used for monitoring during construction should be
sufficient to meet accuracy and reliability requirements needed for the
duration of monitoring.
13.2¬†¬†¬†Pre-Construction Monitoring
The GEOR should develop a plan for preconstruction monitoring of adjacent
buildings and improvements. The GEOR should request that the shoring and
dewatering contractor(s) evaluate the effects of lowering of the groundwater on
adjacent structures and improvements, and define the allowable drop in
groundwater level outside of the excavation. The allowable lowering of the
groundwater elevation should account for the duration of the anticipated
construction-related change in the groundwater level. The GEOR should request
that the dewatering contractor prepare for review and approval a plan of action
in case the groundwater table drop below the contractor‚Äôs specified limit.
13.3¬†¬†¬†Reporting
The baseline and data collected during construction from piezometers and
inclinometers, and field warnings (see section 9 for discussion on warning
level or design limit) should be reported to the design and construction team
in a timely manner. If in response to a field warning any changes are made to
the original design, the revised design should be presented to the GEOR and the
geotechnical members of EDRT for further review.
14.¬†¬†¬†OTHER CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
The geotechnical report should address the following construction
considerations:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The effects of construction on adjacent buildings, notably where ground
improvements or new foundations extend below the foundation of the adjacent
buildings;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The potential of loss of ground and displacements due to construction of
large-diameter drilled shafts installed deeper than the foundation of an
adjacent buildings;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Impact of installation of deep foundations on previously installed
foundations;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The potential impact of ground-surface heave or vibrations on adjacent
structures and improvements;
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The effect of construction on the groundwater level inside and outside
of the construction area.
15.¬†¬†¬†SETTLEMENT MONITORING REQUIREMENTS
Prior to completion of all new tall building projects where the building is
planned to be supported on a shallow foundation underlain by soil (i.e. the
foundation is not bearing directly on bedrock) or on a deep foundation system
not gaining axial support within bedrock or not driven to bedrock / bedrock-
type material, the project Sponsor shall secure a contract with qualified
Monitoring Surveyors and Instrumentation Engineers (MSIEs) to monitor the
settlement of the buildings for a period of 10 years after the issuance of CFC/
TCO. A notarized legal document, completed by the Project Sponsor and recorded
against the property title, with the MSIE‚Äôs contact details, shall be submitted
to DBI prior to issuance of the CFC/TCO and shall be retained with the
project‚Äôs permanent records and readily retrievable within DBI‚Äôs inspection
records on this project.
Settlement monitoring data are to be submitted annually to DBI‚Äôs Building
Inspection Division each year of this 10-year period. Should the settlement
monitoring data exceed the project sponsor‚Äôs geotechnical engineer‚Äôs estimated
time rate of settlement in any annual data reporting period, the project
sponsor/owner is required to immediately notify the DBI‚Äôs Deputy Director for
Inspection Services and bring this condition to his/her attention for immediate
additional investigation.

1)¬†¬†¬†DISCUSSION
Approved construction documents and completed projects must conform to
requirements established in the San Francisco Building Code. San Francisco
Building Code
106A.1.17 requires applications for permits submitted after June 1, 2021 to
construct new buildings to be designed and constructed such that all space
conditioning, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying systems are all-
electric, as defined, and prohibits installation of infrastructure, piping
systems, or piping for distribution of natural gas or propane to such uses.
APPLICABILITY
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 applies to all permit applications submitted on or after June 1, 2021
proposing to construct one or more new buildings in San Francisco.
In the case of Site Permits, the effective date is the date the Site Permit
application (not an addendum) is filed with the Department of Building
Inspection. Addenda to site permits and revisions to permit applications
received before June 1, 2021 are not required to meet the requirements of San
Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17, unless the addenda or revisions change the scope of the project such
that current codes are generally applicable, or such that an exception granted
on the basis of infeasibility is no longer warranted.
Areas Specifically Designated for Commercial Food Service
For projects which submit an initial application for permit:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†On or after June 1, 2021 and before January 1, 2022: Areas specifically
designated for commercial food service may provide gas piping systems,
fixtures, and infrastructure exclusively for cooking equipment within the area
designated for commercial food service.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†January 1, 2022 or thereafter: Permission may be granted to install gas
piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure exclusively to serve cooking
equipment within an area designated for a specific commercial food service
establishment, such as a specific restaurant. To provide sufficient evidence
that gas infrastructure and piping are necessary, the following must be
provided by completing Attachment 3: Application for Exception for Commercial
Food Service:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Name of the food service establishment and food service establishment
owner contact information
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Specification of the gas cooking appliances proposed, and fuel
consumption rating for each device
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†For each proposed gas cooking appliance, state the reason gas is
necessary, such as technological availability or specialized food preparation
process.
Projects that contain gas piping systems, fixtures, or infrastructure serving
cooking appliances are by definition ‚Äúmixed-fuel‚Äù and subject to applicable
requirements (see Administrative Bulletin
93).
DEMONSTRATION OF COMPLIANCE
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 is a provision enacted for protection of health and safety. For
administrative efficiency, no special documentation is necessary for projects
that comply with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17. Projects that do not seek an exception are to document compliance
via normal documentation requirements and procedures, such as:
Piping Systems and Mechanical Systems
Project submittals providing any construction detail related to piping systems
or mechanical system design must be all-electric and consistent with the
requirements of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17. Documentation of compliance with California Title 24 Part 6 Energy
Standards shall not include any indication of gas consumption for space
conditioning, water heating, cooking, or clothes drying.
San Francisco Green Building Standards
Administrative Bulletin 93 (Implementation of Green Building Regulations)
provides guidance for understanding which provisions of relevant local
ordinances and state building codes apply to a project, describes
implementation procedures, and provides forms to document compliance.
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 (or Environment Code Section 706(d)(7) in the case of municipal
buildings), shall be documented as required by Administrative Bulletin
93:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Permit applications for new construction are not accepted without Green
Building Site Permit Submittal GS-1.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The submittal package for each addendum that includes architectural
details must include a Green Building Submittal checklist incorporated into the
project plans indicating the required measures and referencing location of such
features in the construction documents and providing compliance details for
each requirement. For newly constructed buildings, either GS-2, GS-3, or GS-
6 is required with each addendum.
USES NOT SPECIFICALLY REGULATED
An All-Electric Building or Project as defined by San Francisco Building Code
Section 202 relies on electricity as the source of energy for all space
heating, space cooling, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying. In
addition, building permits are prohibited for projects proposing gas piping
systems, fixtures, or infrastructure for decorative uses and lighting or onsite
generation of electricity (except where primarily fueled by onsite digestion of
organic material). Gas piping systems, fixtures, or infrastructure may be
installed strictly to serve areas and systems outside the scope of the
definitions of an All-Electric Building or Project, and a Mixed-Fuel Building,
such as industrial processes.
In projects that include uses not specifically addressed by San Francisco
Building Code Section
106A.1.17.1, all space heating, space cooling, water heating, cooking, and
clothes drying systems must be designed and constructed as all-electric, and
such a project is defined as ‚Äúall-electric‚Äù for the purpose of compliance with
San Francisco Green Building Code
4.201.3 and
5.201.1.1.
EXCEPTIONS
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 and all other requirements for new construction have been determined
to be practical and feasible. An exception may be made only when either:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†An all-electric project is demonstrated to be physically or technically
infeasible, OR
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Where application of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 would violate the terms of an existing development agreement or other
contract with the City.
This bulletin describes the process for determination of infeasibility and
grant of an exception allowing installation of natural gas piping systems,
fixtures, or infrastructure. An exception shall only apply to the extent
necessary to resolve the demonstrated infeasibility, or to the extent required
under the development agreement or other contract.
Some development agreement projects or other multiphase projects may entail
separate applications for permits to construct infrastructure serving an area
versus buildings constructed after infrastructure is developed. San Francisco
Building Code Section
106A .1.17 applies to any application to construct a building submitted to the
Department of Building Inspection on or after June 1, 2021. If a project
sponsor believes that application of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A .1.17 to a phase of development or to an individual building would violate
the terms of a development or other agreement with the City, the project
sponsor may seek a determination using Attachment 4: Application for Review of
an Existing Agreement. Department of Building Inspection staff will refer the
matter to the City Attorney‚Äôs Office to analyze the request for exception and
the extent to which all or part of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A .1.17 will apply.
2)¬†¬†¬†CRITERIA FOR EXCEPTION ALLOWING A MIXED-FUEL SYSTEM OR AREA
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 allows for approval of exception allowing gas infrastructure and
piping systems to be installed on a case-by-case basis where All-Electric
construction is demonstrated to be physically or technically infeasible.
Physical or technical infeasibility is understood to refer to an exceptional
situation where:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†A project proposal cannot be accomplished due to physical or technical
constraints specific to site and occupancy that prohibit elements, spaces or
features necessary for full and strict compliance with all requirements for new
construction;
¬†¬†¬†AND
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†If a specific system or area is served by gas piping systems, fixtures,
and infrastructure, then the physical or technical infeasibility is resolved,
and the project is able to attain full and strict compliance with all
requirements for new construction.
To qualify for such an exception, the project must:
¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†Undergo a Review of All-Electric Feasibility, resulting in a
determination by the reviewers that there is no means by which a proposed
function or service may be provided by an all-electric design compliant with
all applicable codes; and that the proposed function or service can feasibly be
provided if gas piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure are installed.
¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†Limit installation of natural gas piping systems, fixtures, and
infrastructure to the system or area for which All-Electric design is
infeasible;
¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†Ensure the area and system served by natural gas piping systems
provides for future conversion to All-Electric, by complying with the
applicable provisions of Electric Ready Design Guidelines (Attachment 1) to the
maximum extent feasible.
¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†Demonstrate that the project‚Äôs modified design provides equivalent
fire-protection and health and safety to All-Electric design.
Financial considerations are not a basis for determination of physical or
technical infeasibility.
Criteria for determination of infeasibility:
¬†
Category       Criteria
               Compliance with Title 24 Part 6 Energy Standards for all-electric design may be
               infeasible only if there is no prescriptive option for compliance with the Energy
A) Energy      Standards, nor an option for compliance under the performance method for any system
Standards      or technology serving the specific use.
               Proposal to install a technology, system, or design not allowed under the Energy
               Standards does not demonstrate infeasibility where all-electric technologies,
               systems, or designs are available for compliance with the Energy Standards.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if:
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Electric load calculations are prepared for both mixed-fuel design for a
               specific system or area, and all-electric design, with equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area; and
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The project submits an application for service to the electric utility serving
               the project; and
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The utility determines that (a) the peak electric demand required for the all-
               electric design option cannot be served, and (b) the peak electric demand requested
               for the mixed-fuel design option can be served under substantially similar
               conditions. Substantially similar conditions shall include equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area, as well as the same consideration of the time required
               for the utility to complete modifications to utility infrastructure, where
               necessary.
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Where electric service is being provided to a customer by the San Francisco
               Public Utilities Commission (‚ÄúSFPUC‚Äù), and SFPUC confirms the peak electric demand
               requested for the all-electric design option would directly or indirectly require
               SFPUC to do any of the following:
               ¬†¬†¬†(i)¬†¬†¬†Revise a previously submitted application for service to Pacific Gas and
B) Electric    Electric Company (‚ÄúPG&E‚Äù) that is still being reviewed by PG&E;
Utility        ¬†¬†¬†(ii)¬†¬†¬†Submit a new application for service to PG&E for a load for which there is
Infrastructure an existing service agreement with PG&E;
               ¬†¬†¬†(iii)¬†¬†¬†Alter plans for electric infrastructure that have been approved or alter
               infrastructure that are under construction; or
               ¬†¬†¬†(iv)¬†¬†¬†Make changes to existing infrastructure that would impair or limit a
               contract right that exists as of the effective date of this ordinance.
               ¬†¬†¬†Situations (i) to (iv) above do not represent a basis for a finding of
               infeasibility if the same issue applies to a mixed-fuel design constructed at the
               same site with equivalent occupancies, functions, and floor area. Situations (i) to
               (iv) will only apply to developments where an application for wholesale electric
               service relating to the parcel has been submitted to and deemed complete by PG&E as
               of the effective date of the ordinance, and the project sponsor demonstrates it is
               physically or technically infeasible to build all-electric within the electrical
               capacity constraints documented in existing applications for service to PG&E for the
               purpose of serving buildings that were planned but not yet permitted as of the
               effective date of the ordinance. An over-estimation of ampacity requirements for
               all-electric design compared to mixed fuel is not a basis for exception.
               Under California Public Utilities Commission Rule 2.C, utilities are obligated to
               provide service. Request by the utility for the customer‚Äôs proposal to comply with
               applicable tariff, easement, safety, and reliability requirements, or for reasonable
               time to construct improvements, is not a basis for infeasibility.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if:
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Electric load calculations are prepared for both a design including a specific
               mixed-fuel system and area, and all-electric design, with equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area; and
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Based on the rules published by the electric utility serving the site:
               ¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Peak electric demand for the mixed-fuel design does not require the
C) Physical    installation of an electric service transformer; and
Constraint in  ¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Peak electric demand for all-electric design with the same features requires
Small Infill   the installation of an electric transformer; and
Sites          ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The site has a linear footage of street frontage of 75 feet or less;1 and
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Joint review by the Planning Department and Public Works Department determines
               there is no feasible option to locate an electrical transformer in the building or
               elsewhere on the property, and:
               ¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†The only feasible option is to locate the transformer in a sub-surface vault
               in the public Right of Way; or
               ¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†The sidewalk at the site is less than 10 feet in width, such that a sub-
               surface vault in the public Right of Way infeasible.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if
               ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†It is demonstrated physical or technical constraints specific to site and
               occupancy prohibit elements, spaces or features necessary for full and strict

               Proposal to install a technology, system, or design that is inconsistent with, or
               not allowed by the discretionary determination by a City agency shall not be a basis
               for demonstration of infeasibility.
¬†
3)¬†¬†¬†REVIEW FOR DETERMINATION OF INFEASIBILITY
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 and all other requirements for new construction have been determined
to be practical and feasible in general. San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 allows for approval of exception allowing gas infrastructure and
piping systems to be installed on a case-by-case basis where All-Electric
construction is demonstrated to be infeasible.
The conditions of infeasibility depend substantially on design details, and
design development provides substantial opportunity to address physical and
technical conditions. An application for design review for exception due to
infeasibility will not be approved in the absence of substantial architectural
detail, including the architectural addendum and Title 24 compliance
documentation.
Prior to DBI review of an application for exception due to infeasibility, a
Review of All-Electric Feasibility must be completed by engineers with
specialized understanding of electrical engineering, mechanical design, energy
efficiency including compliance with Title 24 Energy Standards, and experience
with the design of all-electric systems for space conditioning and water
heating. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the Design Professional of
Record, with the support of the entire project team, to apply all available
energy efficiency and electric load minimization practices.
Review of All-Electric Feasibility
Review of All-Electric Feasibility is a document that addresses three
questions:
¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†What specific constraint causes all-electric design to be physically or
technically infeasible, but does not apply to mixed-fuel?
¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Can the constraint be resolved?
¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Is the area and system proposed served by gas piping systems ready for
conversion to all-electric in the future, and constructed to provide equivalent
health, safety and fire protection?
To address these questions, a Review of All-Electric Feasibility must include:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Identify the physical or technical constraint: Document the specific
physical or technical issue that results in the infeasibility of All-Electric
design of the project.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Identify alternatives: Based on review of plans, calculations, and
supporting documentation, identify methods, equipment, and design features
available to resolve the physical or technical issue to mitigate infeasibility.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Efficiency: Where the issue relates to peak electrical load, energy
efficiency construction practices, design options, and compliance credits can
commonly contribute to resolving the issue. For the all-electric design,
confirm all available compliance credits have been applied. Confirm all
available energy efficiency design and construction practices have been applied
to all building features contributing to loads regulated by Title 24 Energy
Standards. Confirm equipment specified is no less efficient than prescriptive
baseline specified by Title 24 Energy Standards.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Mechanical: Review envelope and architectural features and mechanical
design are consistent with minimization of load on mechanical equipment.
Determine whether space conditioning and water heating electric peak load can
be reduced via piping or plumbing design, equipment sizing, equipment layout,
or substitution of equipment type. Mechanical equipment must be no less
efficient than electric prescriptive baseline, where such a baseline is
provided by Title 24 Energy Standards. 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Electrical: Review electrical panel schedule and load calculations
for the all-electric design. Confirm connected electrical load and demand
electric load for the all-electric design are calculated in accord with
California Electrical Code, and are consistent with the design for compliance
with Title 24 Energy Standards.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬∞¬†¬†¬†Provide documentation of examples of all-electric design and
construction of similar systems and circumstances.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Document Available Solutions: Review the mixed-fuel design, and document
the specific area and system proposed as mixed-fuel. Confirm that the physical
or technical constraint will specifically be resolved by granting an exception
allowing mixed-fuel construction of the area and system. Confirm proposed gas
piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure are limited to the system or area
of the building for which All-Electric design is infeasible.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Apply Electric Ready Design Guidelines: Areas served by gas piping
systems, fixtures, and infrastructure must prepare for future retrofit to all-
electric by installing sufficient electrical conductors and raceways, bus bar
capacity, and overcurrent protection, and providing sufficient space and
drainage for future replacement of gas systems with electric. Reviewers shall
affirm that the project design conforms to the relevant provisions of Electric
Ready Design Guidelines to the extent feasible.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Recommendation Regarding Health, Safety, and Fire Protection: Review
construction methods, safety equipment, and design features proposed. Recommend
specific design features, equipment, and construction practices sufficient to
ensure the project‚Äôs modified design provides equivalent fire protection and
health and safety to all-electric design.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Documentation of the above via a report addressing each item above in
detail.
Review documentation must be incorporated into plans, with signature by a
reviewer for each discipline (electrical, mechanical, and architectural/Title
24), and stamp by the Design Professional of Record.
