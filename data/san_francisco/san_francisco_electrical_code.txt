   Nothing contained in this code shall be construed to require any existing
electrical equipment, wiring or systems regulated by this code to be altered,
reconstructed, removed or demolished, providing such existing electrical
equipment, wiring or system was installed and maintained in accordance with the
adopted code in effect at the time of installation or subsequent alteration.
   Unused conductors and cables shall be either removed or suitably identified
and terminated in an approved manner.
89.117 Add the following section:
89.117 Alternate Materials, Design and Methods of Construction.
   (A)   Alternates Require Approval: The provisions of this code are not
intended to prevent the use of a product or method of construction not
specifically prescribed by this code, provided any such alternate has been
approved and the use authorized by the Building Official.
   (B)   Equivalency of Alternates. The Building Official may authorize an
alternate, provided the Building Official finds the proposed design is
satisfactory for the intended use and complies with the provisions of this code
and that the product, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at
least equivalent to that prescribed by this code in suitability, strength,
effectiveness, fire resistivity, durability and safety.
   (C)   Evidence Required. The Building Official shall require sufficient
evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claims made regarding the
use of alternates. The details of any action granting approval of an alternate
shall be recorded and shall be entered in the files of the Department of

involved.
89.119 Add the following section:
89.119 Modifications. When there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of this code, the Building Official may grant
modifications for individual cases. The Building Official shall first find that
a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this code impractical

safety requirements. The details of any action granting modifications shall be
recorded and entered in the files of the Department of Building Inspection.
89.120 Add the following section:
89.120 Permits Required.
   (A)   General. It shall be unlawful for any person toinstall, construct,

employees harmless from all costs, liability and damages resulting, whether
directly or indirectly, from anything in connection with the work included in
the permit, including equipment, methods of construction, inspections and

responsible for all work performed.
   (E)   Homeowner’s Permit. A permit for electrical work in or about a single-

and/or life safety functions.
89.122 Add the following section:
89.122 Permit Issuance.
   (A)   General. An issued permit entitles the permittee to proceed with the
installation described therein. Work done in excess of that shown on the
application will be subject to extra permit fees as set forth in Section
110A, Table 1A-F – Specialty Permit Fees – of the Building Code. The issuance
of a permit does not constitute an approval or an authorization of the work
specified therein. Neither the issuance of a permit, nor the approval by the
Building Official of any document, shall constitute an approval of a violation
of any provision of this code or any law or ordinance. A permit or other
document purporting to give authority to violate any code, law or ordinance
shall not be valid with respect thereto. Permits shall not be transferable.
Proposed electrical installations delineated on a permit application shall be
performed only by the permittee or bona fide employee thereof in accordance
with the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Chapter 2, Part IV. The
permit shall be posted on the job site where the work is to be done.
   (B)   Permit Expiration. Electrical permits expire per Section
106A.4.4 of the San Francisco Building Code. Permit fees may be partially
refunded if cancellation request is made to the Building Official prior to
commencement of the permitted work and within 90 days of the date of permit
issuance. See Section
110A, Table 1A-R – Refunds – of the Building Code for refund.
   (C)   Commencement of Work on Permit Expired Due to Work Not Started. Before
work may be commenced on an expired permit on which no work was performed, a
new permit shall be obtained.
   (D)   Recommencement of Work on Permit Expired Due to Work Not Completed.
The applicant shall secure a new permit for the work not completed. The permit
fee shall be based upon items or work remaining to be done.
   (E)   Cancellation of Permit: Permits may be canceled by the Building
Official:
      (1)   If after inspection, it is judged by a senior inspector that the
permit holder is unable or unwilling to correct an unsafe condition or Code
violations.
      (2)   If the permit was obtained fraudulently or under false pretenses.
89.123 Add the following section:
89.123 Fees.
   (A)   General. Permit and inspection fees, as set forth in Section
110A, Table 1A-E – Electrical Permit Fees – of the Building Code, shall be paid

they shall be payable prior to issuance of Permission to Connect Current,
Certificate of Occupancy, or Declaration of Inspection.
   (B)   Other Fees. A standard hourly inspection fee shall be charged for
services provided by Electrical Inspection Division personnel which are not
otherwise detailed. See Section
110A, Table 1A-G – Inspections, Surveys and Reports – of the Building Code.
   (C)   Work Without Permit – Investigation Fee. If the Building Official
finds that a person, company or entity has performed electrical installation
work for which a permit is required, without first obtaining an electrical
permit and payment of fees, the Building Official shall require the payment of
an investigative fee in addition to the prescribed permit fee. See Section
110A, Table 1A-K – Penalties, Hearings, Code Enforcement Assessments – of the
Building Code for the applicable fees. The payment of such investigation fee
shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this
Code, nor from any penalty prescribed by law. The Building Official may reduce
the investigation fee to two times the amount of the permit fee as called for
in Section
110A, Table 1A-E – Electrical Permit Fees – of the Building Code for work that
was constructed prior to the current building ownership if the owner files with
the Building Official a notarized affidavit together with documents
substantiating such dates of work.
   Appeal of such investigative fee may be filed with the Board of Appeals in
the manner provided in Section 8 et seq. of the Business & Tax Regulations
Code. Such filing shall be subject to the fees and rules of the Board of
Appeals. The Board of Appeals, in reviewing the appeal, may reduce the appealed
amount to not less than two times (2x) the permit fee as set forth in Section
110A, Table 1A-E – Electrical Permit Fees – of the Building Code.
