Exception to Section 150.1(a)3: If a single contiguous subdivision or tract falls in more than one climate zone, all buildings in the subdivision or tract may be designed to meet the performance or prescriptive standards for the climate zone that contains 50 percent or more of the dwelling units.

Note: The Commission periodically updates, publishes, and makes available to interested persons and local enforcement agencies precise descriptions of the climate zones, as specified in Reference Joint Appendix JA2–Weather/Climate Data.

Note: The requirements of Sections 150.0(a) through 150.0(r) apply to newly constructed buildings and Sections 150.2(a) and 150.2(b) specifies changes to the requirements of Sections 150.1(a) through 150.1(c) that apply to additions or alterations.

WATER HEATING	All Buildings	System Shall meet Section 150.1(c)81. Install the specified R-value with an air space present between the roofing and the roof deck, such as standard installation of concrete or clay tile.

2. R-values shown for below roof deck insulation are for wood-frame construction with insulation installed between the framing members. Alternatives including insulation above rafters or above roof deck shall comply with the performance standards.

3. Assembly U-factors for exterior framed walls can be met with cavity insulation alone or with continuous insulation alone, or with both cavity and continuous insulation that results in an assembly U-factor equal to or less than the U-factor shown. Use Reference Joint Appendices JA4 Table 4.3.1, 4.3.1(a), or Table 4.3.4 to determine alternative insulation products to be less than or equal to the required maximum U-factor.

4. Mass wall has a heat capacity greater than or equal to 7.0 Btu/h-ft2.

5. “Interior” denotes insulation installed on the inside surface of the wall. “Exterior” denotes insulation installed on the exterior surface of the wall.

6. Below grade “interior” denotes insulation installed on the inside surface of the wall; and Below grade “exterior” denotes insulation installed on the outside surface of the wall.

7. HSPF means “heating seasonal performance factor.”

8.When whole-house fans are required (REQ), only those whole-house fans that are listed in the Home Ventilating Institute Certified Products Directory may be installed. Compliance requires installation of one or more WHFs whose total airflow cfm is capable of meeting or exceeding a minimum 1.5 cfm/square foot of conditioned floor area as specified by Section 150.1(c)12.

9. A supplemental heating unit may be installed in a space served directly or indirectly by a primary heating system, provided that the unit thermal capacity does not exceed 2 kilowatts or 7,000 Btu/hr and is controlled by a time-limiting device not exceeding 30 minutes.

10. For duct and air handler location: REQ denotes location in conditioned space. When the table indicates ducts and air handlers are in conditioned space, a HERS verification is required as specified by Reference Residential Appendix RA3.1.4.3.8.
