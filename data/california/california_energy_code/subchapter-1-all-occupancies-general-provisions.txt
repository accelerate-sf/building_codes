SECTION 100.2 CALCULATION OF TIME DEPENDENT VALUATION (TDV) ENERGY

Time Dependent Valuation (TDV) energy shall be used to compare proposed designs to their energy budget when using the performance compliance approach. TDV energy is calculated by multiplying the site energy use (electricity kWh, natural gas therms, or fuel oil or LPG gallons) for each energy type times the applicable TDV multiplier. TDV multipliers vary for each hour of the year and by energy type (electricity, natural gas or propane), by climate zone and by building type (low-rise residential or nonresidential, high-rise residential or hotel/motel). TDV multipliers are summarized in Reference Joint Appendix JA3. TDV multipliers for propane shall be used for all energy obtained from depletable sources other than electricity and natural gas.
