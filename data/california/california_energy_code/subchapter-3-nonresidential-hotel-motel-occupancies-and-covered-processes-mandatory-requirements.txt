Exception 1 to Section 120.1(d)1: Demand control ventilation. In intermittently occupied spaces that do not have processes or operations that generate dusts, fumes, mists, vapors or gasses and are not provided with local exhaust ventilation (such as indoor operation of internal combustion engines or areas designated for unvented food service preparation), the rate of outdoor air may be reduced if the ventilation system serving the space is controlled by a demand control ventilation device complying with Section 120.1(d)4 or by an occupant sensor ventilation control device complying with Section 120.1(d)5.

A. For each system with demand control ventilation (DCV), CO2 sensors shall be installed in each room that meets the criteria of Section 120.1(d)3 with no less than one sensor per 10,000 square feet of floor space. When a zone or a space is served by more than one sensor, a signal from any sensor indicating that CO2 is near or at the setpoint within the zone or space, shall trigger an increase in ventilation.

B. CO2 sensors shall be located in the room between 3 feet and 6 feet above the floor or at the anticipated height of the occupants’ heads.

C. Demand ventilation controls shall maintain CO2 concentrations less than or equal to 600 ppm plus the outdoor air CO2 concentration in all rooms with CO2 sensors.

Exception to Section 120.1(d)4C: The outdoor air ventilation rate is not required to be larger than the design outdoor air ventilation rate required by Section 120.1(c)3 regardless of CO2 concentration.

D. Outdoor air CO2 concentration shall be determined by one of the following:

i. CO2 concentration shall be assumed to be 400 ppm without any direct measurement; or

ii. CO2 concentration shall be dynamically measured using a CO2 sensor located within 4 feet of the outdoor air intake.

E. When the system is operating during hours of expected occupancy, the controls shall maintain system outdoor air ventilation rates no less than the rate listed in Table 120.1-A for DCV, times the conditioned floor area for spaces with CO2 sensors, plus the rate required by Section 120.1(c)3 for other spaces served by the system, or the exhaust air rate, whichever is greater.

F. CO2 sensors shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within plus or minus 75 ppm at a 600 and 1000 ppm concentration when measured at sea level and 25°C, factory calibrated and certified by the manufacturer to require calibration no more frequently than once every 5 years. Upon detection of sensor failure, the system shall provide a signal which resets to supply the minimum quantity of outside air to levels required by Section 120.1(c)3 to the zone serviced by the sensor at all times that the zone is occupied.

G. The CO2 sensor(s) reading for each zone shall be displayed continuously, and shall be recorded on systems with DDC to the zone level.

5. Occupant sensor ventilation control devices. Occupant sensing or ventilation controls are required for space-conditioning zones that are both permitted to have their ventilation air reduced to zero while in occupiedstandby mode per Table 120.1-A and required to install occupant sensors to comply with Section 130.1(c)5, 6 and 7. Occupant sensor ventilation control devices used to reduce the rate of outdoor air flow when occupants are not present shall comply with the following:

A. Occupant sensors shall have suitable coverage and placement to detect occupants in the entire space ventilated. In 20 minutes or less after no occupancy is detected by any sensors covering the room, occupant sensing controls shall indicate a room is vacant.

B. When occupant sensors controlling lighting are also used for ventilation, the ventilation signal shall be independent of daylighting, manual lighting overrides or manual control of lighting.

C. When a single zone damper or a single zone system serves multiple rooms, there shall be an occupant sensor in each room and the zone shall not be considered  vacant until all rooms in the zone are vacant.

D. One hour prior to normal scheduled occupancy, the occupant sensor ventilation control shall allow preoccupancy purge as described in Section 120.1(d)2.

E. When the zone is scheduled to be occupied and occupant sensing controls in all rooms and areas served by the zone indicate the spaces are unoccupied, the zone shall be placed in occupied-standby mode.

F. In 5 minutes or less after entering occupied-standby mode, mechanical ventilation to the zone shall be shut off until the space becomes occupied or until ventilation is needed to provide space heating or conditioning. When mechanical ventilation is shut off to the zone, the ventilation system serving the zone shall reduce the system outside air rate by the amount of outside air required for the zone.

G. Where the system providing space conditioning also provides ventilation to the zone, in 5 minutes or less after entering occupied-standby mode, space-conditioning zone setpoints shall be reset in accordance with Section 120.2(e)3.

(e) Ducting for zonal heating and cooling units. Where a return plenum is used to distribute outdoor air to a zonal heating or cooling unit, which then supplies the air to a space in order to meet the requirements of Section 120.1(c)3, the outdoor air shall be ducted to discharge either:

1. Within 5 feet of the unit; or

2. Within 15 feet of the unit, substantially toward the unit, and at a velocity not less than 500 feet per minute.

(f) Design and control requirements for quantities of outdoor air.

1. All mechanical ventilation and space-conditioning systems shall be designed with and have installed ductwork, dampers and controls that allow design minimum outside air rates to be operated at no less than the larger of (1) the minimum levels specified in Section 120.1(c)3; or (2) the rate required for make-up of exhaust systems that are required for an exempt or covered process, for control of odors, or for the removal of contaminants within the space.

2. All variable air volume mechanical ventilation and space-conditioning systems shall include dynamic controls that are capable of maintaining measured outside air ventilation rates within 10 percent of the design minimum outside air ventilation rate at both full and reduced supply airflow conditions. Fixed minimum damper position is not considered to be dynamic and is not an allowed control strategy.

3. All mechanical ventilation and space-conditioning systems shall be tested to confirm their ability to operate within 10 percent of the design minimum outside air rate.

(g) Air classification and recirculation limitations. Air classification and recirculation limitations of air shall be based on the air classification as listed in Table 120.1-A or Table 120.1-C, and in accordance with the requirements of Sections 120.1(g)1 through 4.

A – For high-school and college libraries, the values shown for “Public Assembly Spaces – Libraries” shall be used.

B – Rate may not be sufficient where stored materials include those having potentially harmful emissions.

C – Rate does not allow for humidity control. “Deck area” refers to the area surrounding the pool that is capable of being wetted during pool use or when the pool is occupied. Deck area that is not expected to be wetted shall be designated as an occupancy category.

D – Rate does not include special exhaust for stage effects such as dry ice vapors and smoke.

E – Where combustion equipment is intended to be used on the playing surface or in the space, additional dilution ventilation, source control, or both shall be provided.

SECTION 120.9 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL BOILERS

(a) Combustion air positive shut-off shall be provided on all newly installed boilers as follows:

1. All boilers with an input capacity of 2.5 MMBtu/h (2,500,000 Btu/h) and above, in which the boiler is designed to operate with a nonpositive vent static pressure.

2. All boilers where one stack serves two or more boilers with a total combined input capacity per stack of 2.5 MMBtu/h (2,500,000 Btu/h).

(b) Boiler combustion air fans with motors 10 horsepower or larger shall meet one of the following for newly installed boilers:

1. The fan motor shall be driven by a variable speed drive, or

2. The fan motor shall include controls that limit the fan motor demand to no more than 30 percent of the total design wattage at 50 percent of design air volume.

(c) Newly installed boilers with an input capacity 5 MMBtu/h (5,000,000 Btu/h) and greater shall maintain stack-gas  oxygen concentrations at less than or equal to 5.0 percent by volume on a dry basis over firing rates of 20 to 100 percent.
