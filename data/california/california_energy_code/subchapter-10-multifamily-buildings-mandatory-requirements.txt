i. For each system with demand control ventilation (DCV), CO2 sensors shall be installed in each room that meets the criteria of Section 160.2(c)5C with no fewer than one sensor per 10,000 ft² of floor space. When a zone or a space is served by more than one sensor, a signal from any sensor indicating that CO2 is near or at the setpoint within the zone or space shall trigger an increase in ventilation.

ii. CO2 sensors shall be located in the room between 3 ft and 6 ft above the floor or at the anticipated height of the occupants’ heads.

iii. Demand ventilation controls shall maintain CO2 concentrations less than or equal to 600 ppm plus the outdoor air CO2 concentration in all rooms with CO2 sensors.

Exception to Section 160.2(c)5Diii: The outdoor air ventilation rate is not required to be larger than the design outdoor air ventilation rate required by Section 160.2(c)3 regardless of CO2 concentration.

iv. Outdoor air CO2 concentration shall be determined by one of the following:

a.  CO2 concentration shall be assumed to be 400 ppm without any direct measurement; or

b.  CO2 concentration shall be dynamically measured using a CO2 sensor located within 4 ft of the outdoor air intake.

v. When the system is operating during hours of expected occupancy, the controls shall maintain system outdoor air ventilation rates no less than the rate listed in Table 160.2-B for DCV, times the conditioned floor area for spaces with CO2 sensors, plus the rate required by Section 160.2(c)3 for other spaces served by the system, or the exhaust air rate, whichever is greater.

vi. CO2 sensors shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within plus or minus 75 ppm at a 600 and 1000 ppm concentration when measured at sea level and 25°C, factory calibrated, and certified by the manufacturer to require calibration no more frequently than once every 5 years. Upon detection of sensor failure, the system shall provide a signal that resets to supply the minimum quantity of outside air to levels required by Section 160.2(c)3 to the zone serviced by the sensor at all times that the zone is occupied.

vii. The CO2 sensor(s) reading for each zone shall be displayed continuously, and shall be recorded on systems with digital direct controls (DDC) to the zone level.

E. Occupant sensing ventilation control devices. Occupant sensing ventilation controls are required for space-conditioning zones that are both permitted to have their ventilation air reduced to zero while in occupied-standby mode per Table 160.2-B and required to install occupant sensors to comply with Sections 160.5(b)4Cv, vi and vii. Occupant sensing ventilation control devices used to reduce the rate of outdoor air flow when occupants are not present shall comply with the following:

i. Occupant sensors shall meet the requirements in Section 110.9(b)4 and shall have suitable coverage and placement to detect occupants in the entire space ventilated.

ii. When occupant sensors controlling lighting are also used for ventilation, the ventilation signal shall be independent of daylighting, manual lighting overrides or manual control of lighting.

iii. When a single zone damper or a single zone system serves multiple rooms, there shall be an occupant sensor in each room and the zone shall not be considered vacant until all rooms in the zone are vacant.

iv. One hour prior to normal scheduled occupancy, the occupant sensor ventilation control shall allow preoccupancy purge as described in Section 160.2(c)5B.

v. When the zone is scheduled to be occupied and occupant sensing controls in all rooms and areas served by the zone indicate the spaces are unoccupied, the zone shall be placed in occupiedstandby mode.

vi.  In 5 minutes or less after entering occupiedstandby mode, mechanical ventilation to the zone shall be shut off until the space becomes occupied or until ventilation is needed to provide space heating or conditioning. When mechanical ventilation is shut off to the zone, the ventilation system serving the zone shall reduce the system outside air rate by the amount of outside air required for the zone.

vii.  Where the system providing space conditioning also provides ventilation to the zone, in 5 minutes or less after entering occupied-standby mode, space-conditioning zone setpoints shall be reset in accordance with Section 120.2(e)3.

6. Ducting for zonal heating and cooling units. Where a return plenum is used to distribute outdoor air to a zonal heating or cooling unit that then supplies the air to a space in order to meet the requirements of Section 160.2(c)3, the outdoor air shall be ducted to discharge either:

A. Within 5 feet of the unit; or

B. Within 15 feet of the unit, substantially toward the unit and at a velocity not less than 500 feet per minute.

7.  Design and control requirements for quantities of outdoor air.
