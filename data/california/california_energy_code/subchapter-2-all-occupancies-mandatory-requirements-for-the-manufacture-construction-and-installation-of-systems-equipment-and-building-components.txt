SECTION 110.2 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SPACE-CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT

Certification by manufacturers. Any space-conditioning equipment listed in this section may be installed only if the manufacturer has certified to the Commission that the equipment complies with all the applicable requirements of this section.

(a)  Efficiency. Equipment shall meet the applicable efficiency requirements in Tables 110.2-A through 110.2-N, subject to the following:

1. If more than one efficiency standard is listed for any equipment in Tables 110.2-A through 110.2-N, the equipment shall meet all the applicable standards that are listed; and

2. If more than one test method is listed in Tables 110.2-A through 110.2-N, the equipment shall comply with the applicable efficiency standard when tested with each listed test method; and

3. Where equipment serves more than one function, it shall comply with the efficiency standards applicable to each function; and

4. Where a requirement is for equipment rated at its “maximum rated capacity” or “minimum rated capacity,” the capacity shall be as provided for and allowed by the controls, during steady-state operation.

Exception 1 to Section 110.2(a): Water-cooled centrifugal water-chilling packages that are not designed for operation at ANSI/AHRI Standard 550/590 test conditions of 44°F leaving chilled water temperature and 85°F entering condenser water temperature with 3 gallons per minute per ton condenser water flow shall have a maximum full load kW/ton and NPLV ratings adjusted using the following equation:

Adjusted maximum full-load kW/ton rating = (full-load kW/ton from Table 110.2-D)/Kadj

Adjusted maximum NPLV rating = (IPLV from Table 110.2-D)/Kadj

Where:

Kadj = (A) × (B)

A = 0.00000014592 × (LIFT)4– 0.0000346496 × (LIFT)3+ 0.00314196 × (LIFT)2 – 0.147199 × (LIFT) + 3.9302

LIFT = LvgCond – LvgEvap (°F)

LvgCond = Full-load leaving condenser fluid temperature (°F)

LvgEvap = Full-load leaving evaporator fluid temperature (°F)

B = (0.0015 × LvgEvap) + 0.934

The adjusted full-load and NPLV values are only applicable for centrifugal chillers meeting all of the following full-load design ranges:

• Minimum Leaving Evaporator Fluid Temperature: 36°F

• Maximum Leaving Condenser Fluid Temperature: 115°F

• LIFT ≥ 20°F and ≤ 80°F
• Minimum Leaving Evaporator Fluid Temperature: 36°F

• Maximum Leaving Condenser Fluid Temperature: 115°F

• LIFT ≥ 20°F and ≤ 80°F

Centrifugal chillers designed to operate outside of these ranges are not covered by this exception.

Exception 2 to Section 110.2(a): Positive displacement (air-cooled and water-cooled) chillers with a leaving evaporator fluid temperature higher than 32°F shall show compliance with Table 110.2-D when tested or certified with water at standard rating conditions, per the referenced test procedure.

Exception 3 to Section 110.2(a): Equipment primarily serving refrigerated warehouses or commercial refrigeration.

(b) Controls for heat pumps with supplementary electric resistance heaters. Heat pumps with supplementary electric resistance heaters shall have controls:

1. That prevent supplementary heater operation when the heating load can be met by the heat pump alone; and

2. In which the cut-on temperature for compression heating is higher than the cut-on temperature for supplementary heating, and the cut-off temperature for compression heating is higher than the cut-off temperature for supplementary heating.

Exception 1 to Section 110.2(b): The controls may allow supplementary heater operation during:

A. Defrost; and

B. Transient periods such as start-ups and following room thermostat setpoint advance, if the controls provide preferential rate control, intelligent recovery, staging, ramping or another control mechanism designed to preclude the unnecessary operation of supplementary heating.

Exception 2 to Section 110.2(b): Room air-conditioner heat pumps.

(c) Thermostats. All heating or cooling systems not controlled by a central energy management control system (EMCS) shall have a setback thermostat.

1. Setback capabilities. All thermostats shall have a clock mechanism that allows the building occupant to program the temperature setpoints for at least four periods within 24 hours. Thermostats for heat pumps shall meet the requirements of Section 110.2(b).

Exception to Section 110.2(c): Gravity gas wall heaters, gravity floor heaters, gravity room heaters, noncentral electric heaters, fireplaces or decorative gas appliances, wood stoves, room air conditioners and room air-conditioner heat pumps.

(d) Gas-fired and oil-fired furnace standby loss controls. Gas-fired and oil-fired forced-air furnaces with input ratings ≥ 225,000 Btu/hr shall also have an intermittent ignition or interrupted device (IID), and have either power venting or a flue damper. A vent damper is an acceptable alternative to a flue damper for furnaces where combustion air is drawn from the conditioned space. All furnaces with input ratings ≥ 225,000 Btu/hr, including electric furnaces, that are not located within the conditioned space shall have jacket losses not exceeding 0.75 percent of the input rating.

(e)Open and closed-circuit cooling towers. All open and closed cooling tower installations shall comply with the following:

1. Be equipped with conductivity or flow-based controls that maximize cycles of concentration based on local water quality conditions. Controls shall automate system bleed and chemical feed based on conductivity, or in proportion to metered makeup volume, metered bleed volume, recirculating pump run time, or bleed time. Conductivity controllers shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications in order to maximize accuracy.

2. Documentation of maximum achievable cycles of concentration. Building owners shall document the maximum cycles of concentration based on local water supply as reported annually by the local water supplier, and using the calculator approved by the Energy Commission. The calculator is intended to determine maximum cycles based on a Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) of 2.5 or less. Building owner shall document maximum cycles of concentration on the mechanical compliance form which shall be reviewed and signed by the Professional Engineer (P.E.) of Record.

3. Be equipped with a flow meter with an analog output for flow either hardwired or available through a gateway on the makeup water line.

4. Be equipped with an overflow alarm to prevent overflow of the sump in case of makeup water valve failure. Overflow alarm shall send an audible signal or provide an alert via the energy management control system to the tower operator in case of sump overflow.

5. Be equipped with efficient drift eliminators that achieve drift reduction to 0.002 percent of the circulated water volume for counter-flow towers and 0.005 percent for cross-flow towers.

Exception to Section 110.2(e): Open and closed-circuit cooling towers with rated capacity < 150 tons.

(f) Low leakage air-handling units. To qualify as a low leakage air-handling unit for use for meeting the requirements for applicable low leakage air-handling unit compliance credit(s) available in the performance standards set forth in Sections 150.1(b) and 140.1, the manufacturer shall certify to the Energy Commission that the air-handling unit meets the specifications in Reference Joint Appendix JA9.

c.For purposes of this table, dry cooler performance is defined as the process water flow rating of the unit at the given thermal rating condition divided by the total fan motor nameplate power of the unit and air-cooled condenser performance is defined as the heat rejected from the refrigerant divided by the fan motor nameplate power of the unit.

d.Open cooling towers shall be tested using the test procedures in CTI ATC-105. Performance of factory-assembled open cooling towers shall be either certified as base models as specified in CTI STD-201 or verified by testing in the field by a CTI approved testing agency. Open factory assembled cooling towers with custom options added to a CTI certified base model for the purpose of safe maintenance or to reduce environmental or noise impact shall be rated at 90 percent of the CTI certified performance of the associated base model or at the manufacturer’s stated performance, whichever is less. Base models of open factory-assembled cooling towers are open cooling towers configured in exact accordance with the Data of Record submitted to CTI as specified by CTI STD-201. There are no certification requirements for field-erected cooling towers.

e.Applicable test procedure and reference year are provided under the definitions. For refrigerated warehouses or commercial refrigeration applications, condensers shall comply with requirements specified by Section 120.6(a) or Section 120.6(b).
