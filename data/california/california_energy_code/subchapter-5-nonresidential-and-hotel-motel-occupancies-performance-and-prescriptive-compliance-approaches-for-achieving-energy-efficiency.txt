SECTION 140.1 PERFORMANCE APPROACH: ENERGY BUDGETS

A building complies with the performance approach if the energy budget calculated for the proposed design building under Subsection (b) is no greater than the energy budget calculated for the standard design building under Subsection (a).

(a) Energy budget for the standard design building. The energy budget for the Standard Design Building is determined by applying the mandatory and prescriptive requirements to the proposed design building. The energy budget is the sum of the source energy and TDV energy for space-conditioning, indoor lighting, mechanical ventilation, photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage systems, service water heating and covered process loads.

(b) Energy budget for the proposed design building. The energy budget for a proposed design building is determined by calculating the source energy and TDV energy for the proposed design building. The energy budget is the sum of the source energy and TDV energy for space-conditioning, indoor lighting, mechanical ventilation, photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage systems, and service water heating and covered process loads.

Exception to Section 140.1(b). A community shared solar electric generation system, or other renewable electric generation system, and/or community shared battery storage system, that provides dedicated power, utility energy reduction credits or payments for energy bill reductions to the permitted building and is approved by the Energy Commission as specified in Title 24, Part 1, Section 10-115, may offset part or all of the solar electric generation system or battery storage system TDV energy required to comply with the standards, as calculated according to methods established by the Commission in the Nonresidential ACM Reference Manual.

(c) Calculation of energy budget. The TDV energy for both the standard design building and the proposed design building shall be computed by compliance software certified for this use by the Commission. The processes for compliance software approval by the Commission are documented in the ACM Approval Manual.

10. Internal heat gains. Internal heat gains may be ignored for heating load calculations.

11. Safety factor. Calculated design loads based on 140.4(b)1 through 10 may be increased by up to 10 percent to account for unexpected loads or changes in space usage.

12. Other loads. Loads such as warm-up or cool-down shall be calculated from principles based on the thermal capacity of the building and its contents, the degree of setback, and desired recovery time; or may be assumed to be no more than 30 percent for heating and 10 percent for cooling of the steady-state design loads. In addition, the steady-state load may include a safety factor in accordance with Section 140.4(b)11.

(c)Fan systems. Each fan system moving air into, out of or between conditioned spaces or circulating air for the purpose of conditioning air within a space shall meet the requirements of Items 1, 2 and 3 below.

1.Fan power budget. For each fan system that includes at least one fan or fan array with fan electrical input power ≥ 1 kW, fan system electrical input power (Fan kWdesign,system) determined per Section 140.4(c)1(B) at the fan system design airflow shall not exceed Fan kWbudget as calculated per Section 140.4(c)1(A).

A. Calculation of fan power budget (Fan kWbudget). For each fan system:

i.Determine the fan system airflow and choose the appropriate table(s) for fan power allowance.

a.For single-cabinet fan systems, use the fan system airflow and the power allowances in both Table 140.4-A and Table 140.4-B.

b.For supply-only fan systems, use the fan system airflow and power allowances in Table 140.4-A.

c.For relief fan systems, use the design relief
airflow and the power allowances in Table 140.4-B.

d.For exhaust, return and transfer fan systems, use the fan system airflow and the power allowances in Table 140.4-B.

e.For complex fan systems, separately calculate the fan power allowance for the supply and return/exhaust systems and sum them. For the supply airflow, use supply airflow at the fan system design conditions, and the power allowances in Table 140.4-A. For the return exhaust airflow, use return/exhaust airflow at the fan system design conditions, and the power allowances in Table 140.4-B.

ii.For each fan system determine the components included in the fan system and sum the fan power allowances of those components. All fan systems shall include the system base allowance. If, for a given component, only a portion of the fan system airflow passes through the component, calculate the fan power allowance for that component per Equation 140.4-A:

Where

FPAadj = The corrected fan power allowance for the component in W/cfm.

Qcomp = The airflow through component in cfm.

Qsys =  The fan system airflow in cfm.

FPAcomp= The fan power allowance of the component from Table 140.4A or Table 140.4B.

iii.Multiply the fan system airflow by the sum of the fan power allowances for the fan system.

iv.Divide by 1000 to convert to Fan kWbudget.

v.For building sites at elevations greater than 3,000 feet, multiply Fan kWbudget by the correction factor in Table 140.4-C.

B.Determining fan system electrical input power (Fan kWdesign,system). Fan kWdesign,system is the sum of Fan kWdesign for each fan or fan array included in the fan system with Fan kWdesign ≥ 1 kW. If variable speed drives are used, their efficiency losses shall be included. Fan input power shall be calculated with two times the clean filter pressure drop, which is the mean of the clean filter pressure drop and design final filter pressure drop. The Fan kWdesign for each fan or fan array shall be determined using one of the following methods. There is no requirement to use the same method for all fans in a fan system:

i.Use the default Fan kWdesign in Table 140.4-D for one or more of the fans. This method cannot be used for complex fan systems.

ii.Use the Fan kWdesign at fan system design conditions provided by the manufacturer of the fan, fan array, or equipment that includes the fan or fan array calculated per a test procedure included in USDOE 10 CFR Part 430, USDOE 10 CFR Part 431, ANSI/AMCA Standard 208-2018, ANSI/AMCA Standard 210-2016, AHRI Standard 430-2020, AHRI Standard 440-2019 or ISO 5801-2017.

iii.Use the Fan kWdesign provided by the manufacturer, calculated at fan system design conditions per one of the methods listed in Section 5.3 of ANSI/AMCA 208-2018.

iv.Determine the Fan kWdesign by using the maximum electrical input power provided on the motor nameplate.

2. Variable air volume (VAV) systems.

A. Static pressure sensor location. Static pressure sensors used to control variable air volume fans shall be placed in a position such that the controller set point is no greater than one-third the total design fan static pressure, except for systems with zone reset control complying with Section 140.4(c)2B. If this results in the sensor being located downstream of any major duct split, multiple sensors shall be installed in each major branch with fan capacity controlled to satisfy the sensor furthest below its setpoint; and

B. Setpoint reset. For systems with direct digital control of individual zone boxes reporting to the central control panel, static pressure setpoints shall be reset based on the zone requiring the most pressure; i.e., the setpoint is reset lower until one zone damper is nearly wide open.

3. Fractional HVAC motors for fans. HVAC motors for fans that are less than 1 hp and 1/12 hp or greater shall be electronically-commutated motors or shall have a minimum motor efficiency of 70 percent when rated in accordance with NEMA Standard MG 1-2006 at full load rating conditions. These motors shall also have the means to adjust motor speed for either balancing or remote control.

SECTION 140.6 PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS  FOR INDOOR LIGHTING

A building complies with this section if:

i. The calculation of adjusted indoor lighting power of all proposed building areas combined, calculated under Subsection (a) is no greater than the calculation of allowed indoor lighting power, specific methodologies calculated under Subsection (c); and

ii. The calculation of allowed indoor lighting power, general rules comply with Subsection (b).

The prescriptive limits on indoor lighting power are the smaller of the adjusted and allowed indoor lighting power values determined in accordance with Item i.

(a)Calculation of adjusted indoor lighting power. The adjusted indoor lighting power of all proposed building areas is the total watts of all planned permanent and portable lighting systems in all areas of the proposed building; subject to the applicable adjustments under Subdivisions 1 through 4 of this subsection and the requirements of Subdivision 4 of this subsection.

Exception to Section 140.6(a): Up to 0.3 watts per square foot of portable lighting for office areas shall not be required to be included in the calculation of actual indoor lighting power.

1. Two interlocked lighting systems. No more than two lighting systems may be used for an area, and if there are two they must be interlocked. Where there are two interlocked lighting systems, the watts of the lower wattage system may be excluded from the adjusted indoor lighting power density if:

A. An installation certificate detailing compliance with Section 140.6(a)1 is submitted in accordance with Sections 10-103 and 130.4; and

B. The area or areas served by the interlocking systems is an auditorium, a convention center, a conference room, a multipurpose room or a theater; and

C. The two lighting systems are interlocked with a nonprogrammable double-throw switch to prevent simultaneous operation of both systems.

For compliance with Part 6 a nonprogrammable double-throw switch is an electrical switch commonly called a “single pole double throw” or “three-way” switch that is wired as a selector switch allowing one of two loads to be enabled. It can be a line voltage switch or a low voltage switch selecting between two relays. It cannot be overridden or changed in any manner that would permit both loads to operate simultaneously.

2. Reduction of wattage through controls. In calculating adjusted indoor lighting power, the installed watts of a luminaire providing general lighting in an area listed in Table 140.6-A may be reduced by the product of (i) the number of watts controlled as described in Table 140.6-A, times (ii) the applicable power adjustment factor (PAF), if all of the following conditions are met:

A. An installation certificate is submitted in accordance with Section 130.4(b), and

B. Luminaires and controls meet the applicable requirements of Section 110.9, and Sections 130.0 through 130.5; and

C. The controlled lighting is permanently installed general lighting systems and the controls are permanently installed nonresidential-rated lighting controls.

When used for determining PAFs for general lighting in offices, furniture mounted luminaires that comply with all of the following conditions shall qualify as permanently installed general lighting systems:
When used for determining PAFs for general lighting in offices, furniture mounted luminaires that comply with all of the following conditions shall qualify as permanently installed general lighting systems:

i. The furniture mounted luminaires shall be permanently installed no later than the time of building permit inspection; and

ii. The furniture mounted luminaires shall be permanently hardwired; and

iii. The furniture mounted lighting system shall be designed to provide indirect general lighting; and

iv. Before multiplying the installed watts of the furniture mounted luminaire by the applicable PAF, 0.2 watts per square foot of the area illuminated by the furniture mounted luminaires shall be subtracted from installed watts of the furniture mounted luminaires; and

v. The lighting control for the furniture mounted luminaire complies with all other applicable requirements in Section 140.6(a)2.

D. At least 50 percent of the light output of the controlled luminaire is within the applicable area listed in Table 140.6-A. Luminaires on lighting tracks shall be within the applicable area in order to qualify for a PAF.

E. Only one PAF from Table 140.6-A may be used for each qualifying luminaire. PAFs shall not be added together unless allowed in Table 140.6-A.

F. Only lighting wattage directly controlled in accordance with Section 140.6(a)2 shall be used to reduce the installed watts as allowed by Section 140.6(a)2 for calculating the Adjusted Indoor Lighting Power. If only a portion of the wattage in a luminaire is controlled in accordance with Section 140.6(a)2, then only that portion of controlled wattage may be reduced in calculating adjusted indoor lighting power.

G. Lighting controls used to qualify for a PAF shall be designed and installed in addition to manual, multilevel, and automatic lighting controls required in Section 130.1, and in addition to any other lighting controls required by any provision of Part 6. PAFs shall not be available for lighting controls required by Part 6.

H. To qualify for the PAF for daylight continuous dimming plus OFF control, the daylight control and controlled luminaires shall comply with Section 130.1(d), 130.4(a)3 and 130.4(a)7, and the daylight control shall be continuous dimming and shall additionally turn lights completely OFF when the daylight available in the daylit zone is greater than 150 percent of the illuminance received from the general lighting system at full power. The PAF shall apply to the luminaires in the primary sidelit daylit zone, secondary sidelit daylit zone and skylit daylit zone.
