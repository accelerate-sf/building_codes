Covered processes in additions or alterations to existing buildings that will be nonresidential and hotel/motel occupancies shall comply with the applicable Subsections of Section 120.6 and 140.9.

(a)Lab and Process Facility Exhaust Systems. All newly installed fan systems for a laboratory or process facility exhaust system greater than 10,000 cfm shall meet the requirements of Section 140.9(c).

(b)Computer Rooms. All newly installed computer room cooling systems and uninterruptible power supply systems in additions/alterations shall meet the requirements of Sections 120.6(j), 140.9(a)2 and 140.9(a)4 and comply with Item 1 below.

1.Economizers. Each individual cooling system primarily serving computer rooms in an existing building shall include either:

A.An integrated air economizer capable of partial cooling when additional mechanical cooling is required and capable of providing 100 percent of the expected system cooling load up to 80°F room supply air temperature at outside air temperatures of 55°F dry-bulb and below or 50°F wet-bulb and below, and be equipped with a fault detection and diagnostic system as specified by Section 120.2(i); or

B.An integrated water economizer capable of partial cooling when additional mechanical cooling is required and capable of providing 100 percent of the expected system cooling load up to 80°F room supply air temperature at outside air temperatures of 40°F dry-bulb and below or 35°F wet-bulb and below.

Exception 1 to Section 141.1(b)1: Individual computer rooms with an ITE design load under 5 tons (18 kW) in a building that does not have any economizers.

Exception 2 to Section 141.1(b)1: New cooling systems serving an existing computer room in an existing building with an ITE design load up to a total of 50 tons (176 kW).

Exception 3 to Section 141.1(b)1: New cooling systems serving a new computer room in an existing building with an ITE design load up to a total of 20 tons (70 kW).

(c) Controlled Environment Horticulture Spaces.

1.Indoor growing, space-conditioning systems and dehumidification. All newly installed heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems or dehumidification systems in buildings with indoor growing shall meet the applicable requirements of Sections 120.6(h)1 and 120.6(h)2.

2.Greenhouses, building envelope and space-conditioning systems. A greenhouse being converted to a conditioned greenhouse or additions to a conditioned greenhouse shall meet the requirements of Sections 120.6(h)4 and 120.6(h)5.

3.Indoor growing and greenhouses, horticultural lighting. When alterations to horticultural lighting systems increase lighting wattage or include adding, replacing or altering 10 percent or more of the horticultural luminaires serving an enclosed space, the newly installed, replaced or altered lighting shall meet the requirements of Section 120.6(h)3 for indoor growing or Section 120.6(h)7 for greenhouses.

Exception to Section 141.1(c)3: Any alteration limited to adding lighting controls or replacing lamps, ballasts or drivers.

NOTE: For alterations that change the occupancy classification of the building, the requirements of Section 141.1 apply to the occupancy that will exist after the alterations.
