APPENDIX D FIRE APPARATUS ACCESS ROADS

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix D contains more detailed elements for use with the basic access requirements found in Section 503, which gives some minimum criteria, such as a maximum length of 150 feet and a minimum width of 20 feet, but in many cases does not state specific criteria. This appendix, like Appendices B and C, is a tool for jurisdictions looking for guidance in establishing access requirements and includes criteria for multiple-family residential developments, large one- and two-family subdivisions, specific examples for various types of turnarounds for fire department apparatus and parking regulatory signage.
