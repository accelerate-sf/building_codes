CHAPTER 63 OXIDIZERS, OXIDIZING GASES AND OXIDIZING CRYOGENIC FLUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 63 addresses the hazards associated with solid, liquid, gaseous and cryogenic fluid oxidizing materials, including oxygen in home use, and establishes criteria for their safe storage and protection in indoor and outdoor storage facilities, minimizing the potential for uncontrolled releases and contact with fuel sources. Although oxidizers themselves do not burn, they pose unique fire hazards because of their ability to support combustion by breaking down and giving off oxygen.
