CHAPTER 54 CORROSIVE MATERIALS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 54 addresses the hazards of corrosive materials that have a destructive effect on living tissues. Though corrosive gases exist, most corrosive materials are solid or liquid and classified as either acids or bases (alkalis). These materials may pose a wide range of hazards other than corrosivity, such as combustibility, reactivity or oxidizing hazards, and must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all of their known hazards. The focus of this chapter is on materials whose primary hazard is corrosivity; that is, the ability to destroy or irreparably damage living tissue on contact.
