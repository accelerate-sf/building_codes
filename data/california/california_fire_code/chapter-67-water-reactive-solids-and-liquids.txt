CHAPTER 67 WATER-REACTIVE SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 67 addresses the hazards associated with water-reactive materials that are solid or liquid at normal temperatures and pressures. In addition to their water reactivity, these materials may pose a wide range of other hazards, such as toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness or oxidizing potential. This chapter addresses only those materials whose primary hazard is water reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the exposure to hazards associated with water-reactive materials in a fire or other emergency.

In addition to the provisions of Section 5004.12, floors in storage areas for water-reactive solids and liquids shall be of liquid-tight construction.

6704.1.3 Waterproof room.

Rooms or areas used for the storage of water-reactive solids and liquids shall be constructed in a manner that resists the penetration of water through the use of waterproof materials. Piping carrying water for other than approved automatic sprinkler systems shall not be within such rooms or areas.

Water-reactive solids and liquids stored in quantities greater than 500 cubic feet (14 m3) shall be separated into piles, each not larger than 500 cubic feet (14 m3). Aisle widths between piles shall be not less than the height of the pile or 4 feet (1219 mm), whichever is greater.

Exception: Water-reactive solids and liquids stored in tanks.

Class 2 water-reactive solids and liquids shall not be stored in basements unless such materials are stored in closed water-tight containers or tanks.

Class 3 water-reactive solids and liquids shall not be stored in basements.

Class 2 or 3 water-reactive solids and liquids shall not be stored with flammable liquids.

6704.1.6 Explosion control.

Indoor storage rooms, areas and buildings containing Class 2 or 3 water-reactive solids and liquids shall be provided with explosion control in accordance with Section 911.

6704.2 Outdoor storage.

Outdoor storage of Class 2 water-reactive solids and liquids shall not be within 20 feet (6096 mm) of buildings, lot lines, public streets, public alleys, public ways or means of egress. A 2-hour fire barrier without openings or penetrations, and extending not less than 30 inches (762 mm) above and to the sides of the storage area, is allowed in lieu of such distance. The wall shall either be an independent structure, or the exterior wall of the building adjacent to the storage area.
