CHAPTER 9 FIRE PROTECTION AND LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipment systems to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the California Building Code; however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in the California Building Code. In addition, the special fire protection system requirements based on use and occupancy found in Chapter 4 of the California Building Code are duplicated in this chapter as a user convenience.

SECTION 901 GENERAL

901.1 Scope.

Fire protection and life safety systems or portion thereof not required by this code or the California Building Code shall be allowed to be furnished for partial or complete protection provided that such installed systems meet the applicable requirements of this code and the California Building Code.

901.4.3 Alterations in buildings and structures.

For any alteration within a building or structure, the fire protection and life safety systems shall be extended, altered or augmented to maintain and continue protection within the building or structure. Persons shall not remove or modify any fire protection or life safety system installed or maintained under the provisions of this code or the California Building Code without approval from the fire code official.

901.4.4 Fire areas.

Where buildings, or portions thereof, are divided into fire areas so as not to exceed the limits established for requiring a fire protection system in accordance with this chapter, such fire areas shall be separated by fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the California Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the California Building Code, or both, having a fire-resistance rating of not less than that determined in accordance with Section 707.3.10 of the California Building Code.

901.4.5 Additional fire protection systems.

In occupancies of a hazardous nature, where special hazards exist in addition to the normal hazards of the occupancy, or where the fire code official determines that access for fire apparatus is unduly difficult, the fire code official shall have the authority to require additional safeguards and fire protection systems. Fire protection and life safety systems required under this section shall be installed in accordance with this code and the applicable referenced standards.

901.4.6 Appearance of equipment.

Any device that has the physical appearance of life safety or fire protection equipment but that does not perform that life safety or fire protection function shall be prohibited.

901.4.7 Pump and riser room size.

Where provided, fire pump rooms and automatic sprinkler system riser rooms shall be designed with adequate space for all equipment necessary for the installation, as defined by the manufacturer, with sufficient working space around the stationary equipment.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §565.1(a) through (c)] Classification of Hazards.

(a) Light (Low) Hazard. Locations where the total amounts of Class A combustible materials, including furnishings, decorations and contents, is of minor quantity. These shall include buildings or rooms occupied as offices, classrooms, churches, assembly halls, etc. This classification anticipates that the majority of the contents are either noncombustible or so arranged that a fire is not likely to spread rapidly. Small amounts of Class B flammables used for duplicating machines, art departments, etc., are included provided that they are kept in closed containers and safely stored.

(b) Ordinary (Moderate) Hazard. Locations where the total amounts of Class A combustibles and Class B flammables are present in greater amounts than expected under Light (Low) Hazard occupancies. These occupancies could consist of offices, classrooms, mercantile shops and allied storage, light manufacturing, research operations, auto showrooms, parking garages, workshop or support service areas of Light (Low) Hazard occupancies, and warehouses containing Class I or Class II commodities.

(c) Extra (High) Hazard. Locations where the total amount of Class A combustibles and Class B flammables are present, in storage, production use, and/or finished product over and above those expected and classed as Ordinary (Moderate) Hazards. These occupancies could consist of woodworking, vehicle repair, aircraft and boat servicing, individual product display showrooms, product convention center displays, storage and manufacturing processes such as painting, dipping, coating, including flammable liquid handling. Also, included in warehousing of, or in-process storage of other Class I and Class II commodities.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §565.2(a) through (e)] Selection by Hazard.

(a) Extinguishers shall be selected for the specific class or classes of hazards to be protected in accordance with the following subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e).

(b) Extinguishers for protecting Class A hazards shall be selected from the following: Water-type, halogenated agent types, multipurpose dry chemical and wet chemical type.

(c) Extinguishers for protection of Class B hazards shall be selected from the following: carbon dioxide, dry chemical types, halogenated agent types and water-type and water chemical extinguishers rated for Class B hazards.

(d) Extinguishers for protection of Class C hazards shall be selected from the following: carbon dioxide, dry chemical types, halogenated agent types and water mist types rated for Class C. Carbon dioxide extinguishers equipped with metal horns are not considered safe for use on fires in energized electrical equipment and, therefore, are not classified for use on Class C hazards.

(e) Extinguishers and extinguishing agents for the protection of Class D hazards shall be of types approved for use on the specific combustible metal hazard.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §566(a) through (f)] Application for Specific Hazards.

(a) Class B Fire Extinguishers for Pressurized Flammable Liquids and Pressurized Gas Fires. Fires of this nature are considered to be a special hazard. Class B fire extinguishers containing agents other than dry chemical are relatively ineffective on this type of hazard due to stream and agent characteristics. Selection of extinguishers for this type of hazard shall be made on the basis of recommendations by manufacturers of this specialized equipment. The system used to rate extinguishers on Class B fires (flammable liquids in depth) is not applicable to these types of hazards. It has been determined that special nozzle design and rates of agent application are required to cope with such hazards. Caution: It is undesirable to attempt to extinguish this type of fire unless there is reasonable assurance that the source of fuel can be promptly shut off.

(b) Fire extinguishers provided for the protection of cooking appliances that use combustible cooking media (vegetable or animal oils and fats) shall be listed and labeled Class K fires.

(c) Three-dimensional Class B Fires. A three-dimensional Class B fire involves Class B materials in motion such as pouring, running or dripping flammable liquids and generally includes vertical as well as one or more horizontal surfaces. Fires of this nature are considered to be a special hazard. Selection of extinguishers for this type of hazard shall be made on the basis of recommendations by manufacturers of this specialized equipment. The system used to rate extinguishers on Class B fires (flammable liquids in depth) is not directly applicable to this type of hazard.

(d) Water Soluble Flammable Liquid Fires (Polar Solvents). Extinguishers used for the protection of water soluble flammable liquids, such as alcohols, acetones, esters, ketones, etc., shall be selected in accordance with Section 565.2. AFFF-type and FFFP-type fire extinguishers shall not be used for the protection of water soluble flammable liquids, such as alcohols, acetone, esters, ketones, etc., unless specifically referenced on the extinguisher nameplate.

(e) Electronic Equipment Fires. Extinguishers for the protection of delicate electronic equipment shall be selected from the following: carbon dioxide type or a halogenated agent type, or a distilled water mist type with a minimum Class A:C Rating.

(f) In patient care areas and sleeping rooms of health care facilities, fire extinguishers, including the agents and expelling means, should be selected and utilized that would not be detrimental to patients and are appropriate for the type of fire expected, such as distilled water mist type fire extinguishers with a minimum 2-A:C rating.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §567.8] Installation Temperatures.

Water-type (water, AFFF, FFFP) extinguishers shall not be installed in areas where temperatures are outside the range of 40°F to 120°F (4°C to 49°C). Other types shall not be installed in areas where temperatures are outside the range of -40°F to 120°F (-40°C to 49°C). Fire extinguishers shall not be exposed to temperatures outside of the range shown on the fire extinguisher label.

Exceptions:

1. Where fire extinguishers are installed in locations subject to temperatures outside these ranges, they shall be of a type approved and listed for the temperature to which they are exposed, or they shall be placed in an enclosure capable of maintaining the stipulated temperature range.

2. Fire extinguishers containing plain water only can be protected to temperatures as low as -40°F (-40°C) by the addition of an antifreeze stipulated on the extinguisher nameplate. Calcium chloride solutions shall not be used in stainless steel fire extinguishers.

3. Some fire extinguishers are approved or listed for use at temperatures as low as -65°F (-54°C).

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §574.1] Frequency of Inspection.

Fire extinguishers shall be manually inspected when initially placed in service. Thereafter, extinguishers shall be manually inspected at least monthly by the building owner, occupant or his/her authorized agent, or electronically monitored. Fire extinguishers shall be inspected at more frequent intervals when circumstances require, as determined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.
