The provisions of this code applicable to buildings identified in this Subsection 1.11.1 will be identified in the Matrix Adoption Tables under the acronym SFM.

1.11.2 Duties and powers of the enforcing agency.

1.11.2.1 Enforcement.

1.11.2.1.1

The responsibility for enforcement of building standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in the California Building Standards Code relating to fire and panic safety and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal shall be, except as provided in Section 1.11.2.1.2, as follows:

1. The city, county or city and county with jurisdiction in the area affected by the standard or regulation shall delegate the enforcement of the building standards relating to fire and panic safety and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal as they relate to Group R-3 occupancies, as described in Section 310.1 of Part 2 of the California Building Standards Code, to either of the following:

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §1.11] Enforcement of Regulations.

In most instances, the application of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1 to existing occupancies will necessitate the granting of sufficient time to affect the necessary changes. The inspection authority must, therefore, exercise good judgment in authorizing sufficient time to complete the required changes, taking into consideration the degree of danger to life in event of fire while rectification is being carried out. The inspection authority may require immediate compliance with any or all of the regulations, or he may grant a reasonable length of time in which to conform.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §3.12] Enforcement Agency.

(a) The provisions of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1 regulations shall be enforced by the State Fire Marshal, the chief of any city or county fire department or fire protection district, and their authorized representatives, in their respective areas of jurisdiction.

(1) The chief of any city or county fire department or fire protection district, and their authorized representatives shall enforce the rules and regulations in their respective areas.

(2) The State Fire Marshal shall have authority to enforce the rules and regulations in areas outside of corporate cities and county fire protection districts.

(3) The State Fire Marshal shall have authority to enforce the rules and regulations in corporate cities and county fire protection districts upon request of the chief fire official or the governing body.

(c) Regardless of the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above, these regulations shall be enforced in state institutions, state-owned and state-occupied buildings in accordance with the provisions of Section 13108, Health and Safety Code.

(d) Regardless of the above provisions of this section, these regulations shall be enforced only by the State Fire Marshal in every jail or place of detention for persons charged with or convicted of a crime, unless the chief of a city or county fire department or fire protection district, or such chief’s authorized representative, indicates in writing to the State Fire Marshal that inspections of such jails or places of detention will be conducted by the chief or such person’s authorized representative, in their respective area of jurisdiction. The inspections shall be made at least once every two years for the purpose of enforcing the regulations adopted by the State Fire Marshal, pursuant to Section 13143. Reports of inspection conducted pursuant to this subsection shall be on forms provided by the State Fire Marshal and shall be submitted to the official in charge of the facility, the local governing body, the State Fire Marshal and the Corrections Standards Authority within 30 days of the inspections.
