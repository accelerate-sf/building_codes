APPENDIX M HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS—RETROACTIVEAUTOMATIC SPRINKLER REQUIREMENT

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix M was created with the intent to provide an option for adoption by jurisdictions that choose to require existing high-rise buildings to be retrofitted with automatic sprinklers. Modern fire and building codes require complete automatic fire sprinkler protection and a variety of other safety features in new high-rise construction. Many older high-rise buildings lack automatic sprinkler protection and other basic fire protection features necessary to protect the occupants, emergency responders and the structure itself. Without complete automatic sprinkler protection, fire departments cannot provide the level of protection that high-rise buildings demand. Existing high-rise buildings that are not protected with automatic sprinklers represent a significant hazard to occupants and fire fighters, and can significantly impact a community’s infrastructure and economic viability in the event of a fire loss.
