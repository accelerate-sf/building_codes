CHAPTER 65 PYROXYLIN (CELLULOSE NITRATE) PLASTICS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 65 addresses the significant hazards associated with pyroxylin (cellulose nitrate) plastics, which are the most dangerous and unstable of all plastic compounds. The chemically bound oxygen in their structure permits them to burn vigorously in the absence of atmospheric oxygen at a rate 15 times greater than comparable common combustibles. Strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the hazards associated with pyroxylin (cellulose nitrate) plastics in a fire or other emergencies.

SECTION 6501 GENERAL

6501.1 Scope.

This chapter shall apply to the storage and handling of plastic substances, materials or compounds with cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) as a base, by whatever name known, in the form of blocks, sheets, tubes or fabricated shapes.

Cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) motion picture film shall comply with the requirements of Section 306.

6501.2 Permits.

Permits shall be required as set forth in Section 105.5.

SECTION 6502 DEFINITIONS

6502.1 Terms defined in Chapter 2.

Words and terms used in this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 shall have the meanings ascribed to them as defined therein.

SECTION 6503 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

6503.1 Displays.

Cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic articles are allowed to be placed on tables not more than 3 feet (914 mm) wide and 10 feet (3048 mm) long. Tables shall be spaced not less than 3 feet (914 mm) apart. Where articles are displayed on counters, they shall be arranged in a like manner.

6503.2 Space under tables.

Spaces underneath tables shall be kept free from storage of any kind and accumulation of paper, refuse and other combustible material.

6503.3 Location.

Sales or display tables shall be so located that in the event of a fire at the table, the table will not interfere with free means of egress from the room in not less than one direction.

6503.4 Lighting.

Lighting shall not be located directly above cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic material, unless provided with a suitable guard to prevent heated particles from falling.

SECTION 6504 STORAGE AND HANDLING

6504.1 Raw material.

Raw cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic material in a Group F building shall be stored and handled in accordance with Sections 6504.1.1 through 6504.1.7.

6504.1.1 Storage of incoming material.

Where raw material in excess of 25 pounds (11 kg) is received in a building or fire area, an approved vented cabinet or approved vented vault equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system shall be provided for the storage of material.

6504.1.2 Capacity limitations.

Cabinets in any one workroom shall not contain more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg) of raw material. Each cabinet shall not contain more than 500 pounds (227 kg). Each compartment shall not contain more than 250 pounds (114 kg).

6504.1.3 Storage of additional material.

Raw material in excess of that allowed by Section 6504.1.2 shall be kept in vented vaults not exceeding 1,500-cubic-foot capacity (43 m3) of total vault space, and with approved construction, venting and sprinkler protection.

6504.1.4 Heat sources.

Cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic shall not be stored within 2 feet (610 mm) of heat-producing appliances, steam pipes, radiators or chimneys.

6504.1.5 Accumulation of material.

In factories manufacturing articles of cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastics, approved sprinklered and vented cabinets, vaults or storage rooms shall be provided to prevent the accumulation in workrooms of raw stock in process or finished articles.

6504.1.6 Operators.

In workrooms of cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic factories, operators shall not be stationed closer together than 3 feet (914 mm), and the amount of material per operator shall not exceed one shift’s supply and shall be limited to the capacity of three tote boxes, including material awaiting removal or use.

6504.1.7 Waste material.

Waste cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic materials such as shavings, chips, turnings, sawdust, edgings and trimmings shall be kept under water in metal receptacles until removed from the premises.

6504.2 Fire protection.

The manufacture or storage of articles of cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic in quantities exceeding 100 pounds (45 kg) shall be located in a building or portion thereof equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1.

6504.3 Sources of ignition.

Sources of ignition shall not be located in rooms in which cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic in excess of 25 pounds (11 kg) is handled or stored.

6504.4 Heating.

Rooms in which cellulose nitrate (pyroxylin) plastic is handled or stored shall be heated by low-pressure steam or hot water radiators.
