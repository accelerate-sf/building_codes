CHAPTER 53 COMPRESSED GASES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 53 regulates the storage, use and handling of all flammable and nonflammable compressed gases, such as those that are used in medical facilities, air separation plants, industrial plants, agricultural equipment and similar occupancies. Also, this chapter regulates inert gases, such as CO2 used for enrichment and beverage dispensing, that although inert are considered asphyxiants and in larger amounts pose a life safety hazard. Standards for the design, construction and marking of compressed gas cylinders and pressure vessels are referenced. Compressed gases used in welding and cutting, cryogenic liquids and liquefied petroleum gases are also regulated under Chapters 35, 55 and 61, respectively. Compressed gases that are classified as hazardous materials are also regulated in Chapter 50, which includes general requirements.

Where insulated liquid carbon dioxide storage tanks, cylinders, piping and equipment are located indoors, rooms or areas containing storage tanks, cylinders, piping and equipment, and other areas where a leak of carbon dioxide is expected to accumulate, shall be provided with mechanical ventilation in accordance with Section 5004.3 and designed to maintain the room containing carbon dioxide at a negative pressure in relation to the surrounding area.

Exception: A gas detection system complying with Section 5307.3.2 shall be permitted in lieu of mechanical ventilation.

5307.3.2 Gas detection system.

Where ventilation is not provided in accordance with Section 5307.3.1, a gas detection system shall be provided in rooms or indoor areas and in below-grade outdoor locations with insulated carbon dioxide systems. Carbon dioxide sensors shall be provided within 12 inches (305 mm) of the floor in the area where the gas is expected to accumulate or other approved locations. The system shall be designed as follows:

1.Activates an audible and visible supervisory alarm at a normally attended location upon detection of a carbon dioxide concentration of 5,000 ppm (9000 mg/m3).

2.Activates an audible and visible alarm within the room or immediate area where the system is installed upon detection of a carbon dioxide concentration of 30,000 ppm (54 000 mg/m3).

5307.4 Carbon dioxide enrichment systems.

The design, installation and maintenance of carbon dioxide enrichment systems with more than 100 pounds (45.4 kg) of carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide enrichment systems with any quantity of carbon dioxide having a remote fill connection, shall comply with Sections 5307.4.1 through 5307.4.7.

5307.4.1 Documentation.

The following information shall be provided with the application for permit:

1.Total aggregate quantity of liquid carbon dioxide in pounds or cubic feet at normal temperature and pressure.

2.Location and total volume of the room where the carbon dioxide enrichment operation will be conducted. Identify whether the room is at grade or below grade.

3.Location of containers relative to equipment, building openings and means of egress.

4.Manufacturer’s specifications and pressure rating, including cut sheets, of all piping and tubing to be used.

5.A piping and instrumentation diagram that shows piping support and remote fill connections.

6.Details of container venting, including but not limited to vent line size, material and termination location.

7.Alarm and detection system and equipment, if applicable.

8.Seismic support for containers.

5307.4.2 Equipment.

Pressure relief, vent piping, fill indicators, fill connections, vent terminations, piping systems and the storage, use and handling of the carbon dioxide shall be in accordance with Chapter 53 and NFPA 55.

5307.4.3 Gas detection system.

A gas detection system complying with Section 916 shall be provided in rooms or indoor areas in which the carbon dioxide enrichment process is located, in rooms or indoor areas in which container systems are located, and in other areas where carbon dioxide is expected to accumulate. Carbon dioxide sensors shall be provided within 12 inches (305 mm) of the floor in the area where the gas is expected to accumulate or leaks are most likely to occur. The system shall be designed as follows:

1.Activates a low-level alarm upon detection of a carbon dioxide concentration of 5,000 ppm (9000 mg/m3).

2.Activates a high-level alarm upon detection of a carbon dioxide concentration of 30,000 ppm (54 000 mg/m3).

5307.4.3.1 System activation.

Activation of the lowlevel gas detection system alarm shall automatically:

1.Stop the flow of carbon dioxide to the piping system.

2.Activate the mechanical exhaust ventilation system.

3.Activate an audible and visible supervisory alarm signal at an approved location within the building.

Activation of the high-level gas detection system alarm shall automatically:

1.Stop the flow of carbon dioxide to the piping system.

2.Activate the mechanical exhaust ventilation system.

3.Activate an audible and visible evacuation alarm both inside and outside of the carbon dioxide enrichment area, and the area in which the carbon dioxide containers are located.

5307.4.4 Pressurization and ventilation.

Rooms or indoor areas in which carbon dioxide enrichment is provided shall be maintained at a negative pressure in relation to the surrounding areas in the building. A mechanical ventilation system shall be provided in accordance with the California Mechanical Code that complies with all of the following:

1.Mechanical ventilation in the room or area shall be at a rate of not less than 1 cfm per square foot [0.00508 m3/(s × m2)].

2.When activated by the gas detection system, the mechanical ventilation system shall remain on until manually reset.

3.The exhaust system intakes shall be taken from points within 12 inches (305 mm) of the floor.

4.The ventilation system shall discharge to the outdoors in an approved location.

5307.4.5 Signage.

Hazard identification signs shall be posted at the entrance to the room and indoor areas where the carbon dioxide enrichment process is located, and at the entrance to the room or indoor area where the carbon dioxide containers are located. The sign shall be not less than 8 inches (200 mm) in width and 6 inches (150 mm) in height and indicate:

CAUTION—CARBON DIOXIDE GAS
VENTILATE THE AREA BEFORE ENTERING.
A HIGH CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2)
GAS CONCENTRATION
IN THIS AREA
CAN CAUSE ASPHYXIATION.
