CHAPTER 10 MEANS OF EGRESS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. This chapter addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.

The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections 1003 through 1031 are duplicated text from Chapter 10 of the California Building Code; however, the California Fire Code contains an additional Section 1032 on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings. Retroactive minimum means of egress requirements for existing buildings are found in Chapter 11. Section 1010 was extensively reorganized for the 2021 edition. For complete information, see the relocations table in the preface information for the California Building Code.

[BE] [BE] 1004.5.1 Increased occupant load.

The occupant load permitted in any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from that number established for the occupancies in Table 1004.5, provided that all other requirements of the code are met based on such modified number and the occupant load does not exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m2) of occupiable floor space. Where required by the fire code official, an approved aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where required by the fire code official, such diagram shall be posted.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §3.30] Posting of Room Capacity.

Any room having an occupant load of 50 or more persons where fixed seats are not installed, and which is used for assembly, classroom, dining, drinking or similar purposes, shall have the capacity of the room posted in a conspicuous place near the main exit from the room. Posting shall be by means of a durable sign having a contrasting color from the background to which it is attached. Signs shall be of an approved type and shall be maintained in a legible manner by the owner or his authorized agent and shall indicate the number of occupants permitted for each room use. No person shall deface or remove such signs except as authorized by the enforcing agency.

[BE] [BE] 1004.6 Fixed seating.

For areas having fixed seats and aisles, the occupant load shall be determined by the number of fixed seats installed therein. The occupant load for areas in which fixed seating is not installed, such as waiting spaces, shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004.5 and added to the number of fixed seats.

The occupant load of wheelchair spaces and the associated companion seat shall be based on one occupant for each wheelchair space and one occupant for the associated companion seat provided in accordance with Chapter 11B of the California Building Code.

For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall be not less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length.

[BE] [BE] 1004.7 Outdoor areas.

Yards, patios, occupied roofs courts and similar outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants shall be provided with means of egress as required by this chapter. The occupant load of such outdoor areas shall be assigned by the fire code official in accordance with the anticipated use. Where outdoor areas are to be used by persons in addition to the occupants of the building, and the path of egress travel from the outdoor areas passes through the building, means of egress requirements for the building shall be based on the sum of the occupant loads of the building plus the outdoor areas.

Exceptions:

1.Outdoor areas used exclusively for service of the building need only have one means of egress.

2.Both outdoor areas associated with Group R-3 and individual dwelling units of Group R-2.

[BE] [BE] 1004.8 Concentrated business use areas.

The occupant load factor for concentrated business use shall be applied to telephone call centers, trading floors, electronic data processing centers and similar business use areas with a higher density of occupants than would normally be expected in a typical business occupancy environment. Where approved by the code official, the occupant load for concentrated business use areas shall be the actual occupant load, but not less than one occupant per 50 square feet (4.65 m2) of gross occupiable floor space.

[BE] [BE] 1004.9 Posting of occupant load.

Every room or space which is used for assembly, classroom, dining, drinking or similar purposes having an occupant load of 50 or more that is an assembly occupancy shall have the occupant load of the room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the main exit or exit access doorway from the room or space, for the intended configurations. Posted signs shall be of an approved legible permanent design and shall be maintained by the owner or the owner’s authorized agent.

SECTION 1005 MEANS OF EGRESS SIZING

[BE] [BE] 1005.1 General.

All portions of the means of egress system shall be sized in accordance with this section.

Exception: Aisles and aisle accessways in rooms or spaces used for assembly purposes complying with Section 1030.

[BE] [BE] 1005.2 Minimum width based on component.

The minimum width, in inches (mm), of any means of egress components shall be not less than that specified for such component, elsewhere in this code.

[BE] [BE] 1005.3 Required capacity based on occupant load.

The required capacity, in inches (mm), of the means of egress for any room, area, space or story shall be not less than that determined in accordance with Sections 1005.3.1 and 1005.3.2.

[BE] [BE] 1005.3.1 Stairways.

The capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.3 inch (7.6 mm) per occupant. Where stairways serve more than one story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the required capacity of the stairways serving that story.

Exceptions:

1.For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5.1 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.

2.Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1030.6.2 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.

3.Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity factors in Section 1030.6.3 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

4.For Group H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4 occupancies, the total width of means of egress in inches (mm) shall not be less than the total occupant load served by the means of egress multiplied by 0.7 inches (7.62 mm) per occupant.

[BE] [BE] 1005.3.2 Other egress components.
