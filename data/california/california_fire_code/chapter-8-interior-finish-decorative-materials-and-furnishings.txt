CHAPTER 8 INTERIOR FINISH, DECORATIVE MATERIALS AND FURNISHINGS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 8 provides requirements for interior finishes, decorative materials and furnishings in new and existing buildings so that they do not significantly add to or create fire hazards in buildings. The provisions tend to focus on occupancies with specific risk characteristics, such as vulnerability of occupants, density of occupants, lack of familiarity with the building and societal expectations of importance. This chapter is consistent with Chapter 8 of the California Building Code which regulates the interior finishes and decorative materials of new buildings.

SECTION 801 GENERAL

801.1 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter shall govern interior finish, interior trim, furniture, furnishings, decorative materials and decorative vegetation in buildings. Existing buildings shall comply with Sections 803 through 808. New buildings shall comply with Sections 804 through 808, and Section 803 of the California Building Code.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §1172] Purpose.

California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 8 have been prepared and adopted for the purpose of establishing minimum standards for the prevention of fire and for the protection of life and property against fire and panic through the use of flame-retardant chemicals, fabrics and materials.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §1173] Scope.

California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 8 shall govern the manufacture, sale and application of flame-retardant chemicals used in connection with fabrics or materials required to be treated and maintained in a flame-retardant condition as provided in Sections 13115 or 13119 of the Health and Safety Code. These rules and regulations shall also apply to fabrics or materials inherently nonflammable and, they shall also establish minimum fire-resistive standards for such fabrics or materials.

California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 8 shall also establish minimum standards and specific procedures for the approval of flame-retardant chemicals, flame retardant materials and flame retardant applicator concerns.

[California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, §1174] Basis.

California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 8 are based upon the presumption of fact that fabrics and similar materials commonly known to be flammable increase, or may cause the increase of, the hazard or menace of fire; that proper and adequate flame-retardant treatment through the use of certain chemicals is possible whereby the danger to life and property from fire and panic can be materially reduced; and, that there do exist certain fabrics and materials which by nature are nonflammable.

SECTION 802 DEFINITIONS

802.1 Definitions.
