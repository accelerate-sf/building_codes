Actual construction of such buildings shall commence on or before January 1, 1976, unless all provisions for new buildings have been met.

Note: It is the intent of this section that, in determining the level form which the highest occupied floor is to be measured, the enforcing agency should exercise reasonable judgment, including consideration of overall accessibility to the building by fire department personnel and vehicular equipment. When a building is situated on sloping terrain and there is building access on more than one level, the enforcing agency may select the level which provides the most logical and adequate fire department access.

1114.2 Compliance data.

Except as may be otherwise specified, existing high-rise building shall conform to the applicable requirements of these regulations by April 26, 1979.

SECTION 1115 EXISTING GROUP I OCCUPANCIES [SFM] [SFM]

1115.1 General.

Existing buildings housing existing protective social-care homes or facilities established prior to March 4, 1972 may have their use continued if they conform, or are made to conform, to the following provisions:

1115.2 Use of floors.

The use of floor levels in buildings of Type III, IV or V nonfire-rated construction may be as follows: Nonambulatory—first floor only; Ambulatory—not higher than the third-floor level, provided walls and partitions are constructed of materials equal in fire-resistive quality to that of wood lath and plaster in good repair and all walls are firestopped at each floor level.

1115.3 Enclosure of exits and vertical openings.

Except for two-story structures housing ambulatory guests, all interior stairs shall be enclosed in accordance with Chapter 10 of the California Building Code. In lieu of stairway enclosures, floor separations or smoke barriers may be provided in such a manner that fire and smoke will not spread rapidly to floors above or otherwise impair exit facilities. In these instances, floor separations or smoke barriers shall have a fire resistance equal to not less than 1/2-inch (13 mm) gypsum wall board on each side of wood studs with openings protected by not less than a 13/4-inch (44.5 mm) solid bonded wood-core door of the self-closing type. All other vertical openings shall be enclosed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1114.6 and 1114.13.

1115.4 Exit access.

Each floor or portion thereof of buildings used for the housing of existing protective social-care homes or facilities shall have access to not less than two exits in such a manner as to furnish egress from the building or structure in the event of an emergency substantially equivalent to the provisions of Chapter 10 of the California Building Code.

1115.5 Corridor openings.

Openings from rooms to interior corridors shall be protected by not less than 13/4-inch (44.5 mm) solid-bonded wood-core doors. Transoms and other similar openings shall be sealed with materials equivalent to existing corridor wall construction.

1115.6 Interior finishes.

Interior wall and ceiling finishes shall conform to the requirements for a Group R-1 Occupancy as specified in Chapter 8 of the California Building Code.

1115.7 Automatic fire sprinklers.

Automatic sprinkler systems shall be installed in existing protective social-care occupancies in accordance with the provisions of Section 903.2.6 of the California Building Code.

1115.8 Fire alarm systems.

Automatic fire alarm systems shall be installed in existing protective social-care homes or facilities in accordance with the provisions of Section 907.2.6 of the California Building Code.

Exception: When an approved automatic sprinkler system conforming to Section 903.2.6 of the California Building Code is installed, a separate fire alarm system as specified in this section need not be provided.

SECTION 1116 EXISTING GROUP L AND GROUP H-8 OCCUPANCIES [SFM] [SFM]

1116.1 Repairs general.

Additions, alterations or repairs may be made to any building or structure without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with all the requirements of this code section, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to the requirements of this section.

1116.2 Unsafe condition.

Additions, repairs or alterations shall not be made to an existing building or structure that will cause the existing building or structure to be in violation of any of the provisions of this code, nor shall such additions or alterations cause the existing building or structure to become unsafe, or to be in violation of any of the provisions of this code. An unsafe condition shall be deemed to have been created if an addition or alteration will cause the existing building or structure to become structurally unsafe or overloaded; will not provide adequate egress in compliance with the provisions of this code or will obstruct existing exits; will create a fire hazard; will reduce required fire resistance or will otherwise create conditions dangerous to human life.

1116.3 Changes in use or occupancy.

Any buildings that have alternations or additions, which involves a change in use or occupancy, shall not exceed the height, number of stories and area permitted for new buildings.

1116.4 Buildings not in compliance with code.

Additions or alterations shall not be made to an existing building or structure when such existing building or structure is not in full compliance with the provisions of this code except when such addition or alteration will result in the existing building or structure being no more hazardous, based on life safety, fire safety and sanitation, than before such additions or alterations are undertaken.

1116.5 Maintenance of structural and fire resistive integrity.

Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure that are nonstructural and do not adversely affect any structural member of any part of the building or structure having required fire resistance may be made with the same materials of which the building or structure is constructed. The installation or replacement of glass shall be as required for new installations.

1116.6 Continuation of existing use.

Buildings in existence at the time of the adoption of this code may have their existing use or occupancy continued if such use or occupancy was legal at the time of the adoption of this code, provided such continued use is not dangerous to life.

1116.7 Maximum allowable quantities.

Existing Group H-8 laboratory suites approved prior to January 1, 2008 shall not exceed the maximum allowable quantities listed in Tables 1116.7(1) and 1116.7(2).
