CHAPTER 49 REQUIREMENTS FOR WILDLAND-URBANINTERFACE FIRE AREAS

User note:

About this chapter: In addition to the building construction requirements in the California Building Code and California Residential Code, this chapter contains requirements for development and construction in Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) designated as Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones and areas designated by the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection as State Responsibility Areas (SRA). While many of these provisions are found in Title 14 and Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations, they are replicated here for the code user. The local jurisdiction has the authority to apply the same regulations to LRA when the regulations are adopted by local ordinance.

The requirements in this chapter reference the process for adoption of Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in the LRA; criteria for evaluating existing subdivisions that are at significant fire risk and are without an adequate secondary egress; and criteria for fire safety provisions required in the Safety Element of a city or county General Plan.

The chapter includes mitigation strategies to reduce the hazards of fire originating within a structure spreading to wildland and fire originating in wildland spreading to structures. These strategies are included in the following requirements:

1.Development of fire protection plans.

2.Development of landscape plans and long-term vegetation management.

3.Creation and maintenance of defensible space to protect structures and subdivisions.

SECTION 4901 GENERAL

4901.1 Scope.

This chapter contains minimum requirements to mitigate conditions that might cause a fire originating in a structure to ignite vegetation in the Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area, and conversely, a wildfire burning in vegetative fuels to transmit fire to buildings and threaten to destroy life, overwhelm fire suppression capabilities or result in large property losses.

4901.2 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to reduce the likelihood of life and property loss due to a wildfire through the use of performance and prescriptive requirements for construction and development in State Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) designated as a Moderate, High or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.

SECTION 4902 DEFINITIONS

4902.1 General.

For the purpose of this chapter, certain terms are defined as follows:

DIRECTOR. Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).

FIRE PROTECTION PLAN. A document prepared for a specific project or development proposed for a Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Fire Area. It describes ways to minimize and mitigate potential for loss from wildfire exposure.

FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. Geographical areas designated pursuant to California Public Resources Codes, Sections 4201 through 4204 and classified as Very High, High or Moderate in State Responsibility Areas or as Local Agency Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones designated pursuant to California Government Code, Sections 51175 through 51189.

The California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 1280 entitles the maps of these geographical areas as “Maps of the Fire Hazard Severity Zones in the State Responsibility Area of California.”

FIRE-RESISTANT VEGETATION. Plants, shrubs, trees and other vegetation that exhibit properties, such as high moisture content, little accumulation of dead vegetation, and low sap or resin content, that make them less likely to ignite or contribute heat or spread flame in a fire than native vegetation typically found in the region.

[Note: The following sources contain examples of types of vegetation that can be considered fire-resistant vegetation. (Fire-resistant Plants for Home Landscapes, A Pacific Northwest Extension publication; Home Landscaping for Fire, University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources; Sunset Western Garden Book)]

IGNITION-RESISTANT MATERIAL. A type of building material that complies with the requirements in Section 704A.2 in the California Building Code.

LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS (LRA). Areas of the state in which the financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing fires is the primary responsibility of a city, county, city and county, or district.

STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS (SRA). Lands that are classified by the Board of Forestry pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 4125 where the financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing wildfires is primarily the responsibility of the state.

WILDFIRE.  Any uncontrolled fire spreading through vegetative fuels that threatens to destroy life, property or resources as defined in Public Resources Code, Sections 4103 and 4104.

WILDFIRE EXPOSURE.  One or a combination of radiant heat, convective heat, direct flame contact and burning embers being projected by vegetation fire to a structure and its immediate environment.

WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE (WUI). A geographical area identified by the state as a “Fire Hazard Severity Zone” in accordance with the Public Resources Code, Sections 4201 through 4204, and Government Code, Sections 51175 through 51189, or other areas designated by the enforcing agency to be at a significant risk from wildfires.

The information shall be presented in a format that is understandable and accessible to the general public, including, but not limited to, maps. A local agency shall post a notice at the office of the county recorder, county assessor and county planning agency identifying the location of the map provided by the director pursuant to Government Code, Section 51178. If the agency amends the map, pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 51179, the notice shall instead identify the location of the amended map.
