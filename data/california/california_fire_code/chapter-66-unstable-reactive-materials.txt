CHAPTER 66 UNSTABLE (REACTIVE) MATERIALS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 66 addresses the hazards of unstable (reactive) liquid and solid materials as well as unstable (reactive) compressed gases. In addition to their unstable reactivity, these materials may pose other hazards, such as toxicity, corrosivity, explosivity, flammability or oxidizing potential. This chapter, however, is intended to address those materials whose primary hazard is unstable reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of the code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the exposure hazards associated with unstable (reactive) materials in a fire or other emergency.
