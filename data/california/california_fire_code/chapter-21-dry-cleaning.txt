CHAPTER 21 DRY CLEANING

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 21 provides provisions that are intended to reduce hazards associated with use of flammable and combustible dry cleaning solvents. These materials, like all volatile organic chemicals, generate significant quantities of static electricity and are thus readily ignitable. Many flammable and nonflammable dry cleaning solvents also possess health hazards when involved in a fire.
