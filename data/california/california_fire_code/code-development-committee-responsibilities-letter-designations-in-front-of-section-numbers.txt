In each code development cycle, proposed changes to this code are considered at the Committee Action Hearings by the International Fire Code Development Committee, whose action constitutes a recommendation to the voting membership for final action on the proposed change. Code change proposals to sections of the code that are preceded by a bracketed letter designation are considered by a different code development committee. For example, proposed changes to code sections that have [BE] in front of them (e.g., [BE] 604.4) are considered by the appropriate International Building Code Development Committee (IBC—Egress) at the code development hearings.

The bracketed letter designations for committees responsible for portions of this code are as follows:

[A]	=	Administrative Code Development Committee
[BE]	=	IBC—Egress Code Development Committee
[BF]	=	IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee
[BG]	=	IBC—General Code Development Committee
[BS]	=	IBC—Structural Code Development Committee
[EB]	=	International Existing Building Code Development Committee
[FG]	=	International Fuel Gas Code Development Committee
[M]	=	International Mechanical Code Development Committee
[P]	=	International Plumbing Code Development CommitteeFor the development of the 2024 edition of the I-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years, as shown in the following Code Development Hearings table.

The majority of the sections of Chapter 1 of this code are designated as the responsibility of the Administrative Code Development Committee, and that committee is part of the Group B portion of the hearings. This committee will conduct its code development hearings in 2022 to consider most code change proposals for Chapter 1 of this code and proposals for Chapter 1 of all I-Codes except the IECC, IRC and IgCC. Therefore, any proposals received for Chapter 1 of this code preceded by the designation [A] will be assigned to the Administrative Code Development Committee for consideration in 2022.

It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understands which code development committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal.
