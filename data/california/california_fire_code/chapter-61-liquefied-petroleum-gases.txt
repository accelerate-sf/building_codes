CHAPTER 61 LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 61 provides requirements for the safe handling, storing and use of LP-gas to reduce the possibility of damage to containers, accidental releases of LP-gas, and exposure of flammable concentrations of LP-gas to ignition sources. LP-gas (notably propane) is well-known as a camping fuel for cooking, lighting, heating and refrigerating and also remains a popular standby fuel supply for auxiliary generators, as well as being widely used as an alternative motor vehicle fuel. Its characteristic as a clean-burning fuel has resulted in the addition of propane dispensers to service stations throughout the country. Dispensing LP-gas into motor vehicles is addressed by Chapter 23.
