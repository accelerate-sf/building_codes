The matrix adoption tables, examples of which follow, are non-regulatory aids intended to show the user which state agencies have adopted and/or amended given sections of the model code. An agency's statutory authority for certain occupancies or building applications determines which chapter or section may be adopted, repealed, amended or added. See Chapter 1, Division I, Sections 1.2 through 1.14 for agency authority, building applications and enforcement responsibilities.

The side headings identify the scope of state agencies’ adoption as follows:

If there is an “X” under a particular state agency’s acronym on this row; this means that particular state agency has adopted the entire model code chapter without any state amendments.

Example:

(Matrix Adoption Tables are non-regulatory, intended only as an aid to the user. See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
