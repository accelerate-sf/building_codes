APPENDIX F HAZARD RANKING

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix F is intended to be a companion to the specific requirements of Chapters 51 through 67, which regulate the storage, handling and use of all hazardous materials classified as either physical or health hazards. These materials pose diverse hazards, including instability, reactivity, flammability, oxidizing potential or toxicity; therefore, identifying them by hazard ranking is essential. This appendix lists the various hazardous material categories that are defined in this code, along with the NFPA 704 hazard ranking for each.

SECTION F101 GENERAL

F101.1 Scope.

Assignment of levels of hazards to be applied to specific hazard classes as required by NFPA 704 shall be in accordance with this appendix. The appendix is based on application of the degrees of hazard as defined in NFPA 704 arranged by hazard class as for specific categories defined in Chapter 2 of the California Fire Code and used throughout.

F101.2 General.

The hazard rankings shown in Table F101.2 have been established by using guidelines found within NFPA 704. As noted in Section 4.2 of NFPA 704, there could be specific reasons to alter the degree of hazard assigned to a specific material; for example, ignition temperature, flammable range or susceptibility of a container to rupture by an internal combustion explosion or to metal failure while under pressure or because of heat from external fire. As a result, the degree of hazard assigned for the same material can vary when assessed by different people of equal competence.

The hazard rankings assigned to each class represent reasonable minimum hazard levels for a given class based on the use of criteria established by NFPA 704. Specific cases of use or storage may dictate the use of higher degrees of hazard in certain cases.
