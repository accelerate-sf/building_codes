CHAPTER 7 FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides requirements to maintain the fire-resistance ratings of building elements and to limit fire spread. Section 701 addresses the maintenance of and owner’s responsibility for construction elements such as fire barriers and smoke barriers. The rest of the chapter deals with various aspects that also must be maintained to achieve overall fire resistance of the main fire- and smoke-resistive features. These include penetrations, joint protection, door and window openings, and duct and air transfer opening protection.

SECTION 701 GENERAL

701.1 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter shall govern the inspection and maintenance of the materials, systems and assemblies used for structural fire resistance, fire-resistance-rated construction separation of adjacent spaces and construction installed to resist the passage of smoke to safeguard against the spread of fire and smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from buildings. New buildings shall comply with the California Building Code.

701.2 Fire-resistance-rated construction.

The fire-resistance rating of the following fire-resistance-rated construction shall be maintained:

1.Structural members.

2.Exterior walls.

3.Fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions.

4.Horizontal assemblies.

5.Shaft enclosures.

701.2.1 Hanging displays.

The hanging and displaying of salable goods and other decorative materials from acoustical ceiling systems that are part of a fire-resistance-rated horizontal assembly shall be prohibited.

701.3 Smoke barriers.

The fire-resistance rating and smokeresistant characteristics of smoke barriers shall be maintained.

701.4 Smoke partitions.

The smoke-resistant characteristics of smoke partitions shall be maintained.

701.5 Maintaining protection.

Materials, systems and devices used to repair or protect breaches and openings in fire-resistance-rated construction and construction installed to resist the passage of smoke shall be maintained in accordance with Sections 703 through 707.

701.6 Owner’s responsibility.

The owner shall maintain an inventory of all required fire-resistance-rated construction, construction installed to resist the passage of smoke and the construction included in Sections 703 through 707 and Sections 602.4.1 and 602.4.2 of the California Building Code. Such construction shall be visually inspected by the owner annually and properly repaired, restored or replaced where damaged, altered, breached or penetrated. Records of inspections and repairs shall be maintained. Where concealed, such elements shall not be required to be visually inspected by the owner unless the concealed space is accessible by the removal or movement of a panel, access door, ceiling tile or similar movable entry to the space.

701.7 Unsafe conditions.

Where any components in this chapter are not maintained and do not function as intended or do not have the fire resistance or the resistance to the passage of smoke required by the code under which the building was constructed, remodeled or altered, such component(s) or portion thereof shall be deemed an unsafe condition, in accordance with Section 114.1.1. Components or portions thereof determined to be unsafe shall be repaired or replaced to conform to that code under which the building was constructed, remodeled or altered or this chapter, as deemed appropriate by the fire code official.

Where the condition of components is such that any building, structure or portion thereof presents an imminent danger to the occupants of the building, structure or portion thereof, the fire code official shall act in accordance with Section 114.2.

SECTION 702 DEFINITIONS

The materials and firestop systems shall be securely attached to or bonded to the construction being penetrated with no openings visible through or into the cavity of the construction. Where the system design number is known, the system shall be inspected to the listing criteria and manufacturer’s installation instructions.

703.2 Repair of penetrations.

Where damaged, materials used to protect membrane- and through-penetrations shall be replaced or restored with materials or systems that meet or exceed the code requirements applicable at the time when the assembly was constructed, remodeled or altered.

SECTION 704 JOINTS AND VOIDS

704.1 Maintaining protection.

Where required when the building was originally constructed, materials and systems used to protect joints and voids in the following locations shall be maintained. The materials and systems shall be securely attached to or bonded to the adjacent construction, without openings visible through the construction.

1.Joints in or between fire-resistance-rated walls, floors or floor/ceiling assemblies and roof or roof/ceiling assemblies.

2.Joints in smoke barriers.

3.Voids at the intersection of a horizontal floor assembly and an exterior curtain wall.

4.Voids at the intersection of a horizontal smoke barrier and an exterior curtain wall.

5.Voids at the intersection of a nonfire-resistance-rated floor assembly and an exterior curtain wall.

6.Voids at the intersection of a vertical fire barrier and an exterior curtain wall.

7.Voids at the intersection of a vertical fire barrier and a nonfire-resistance-rated roof assembly.

Unprotected joints and voids do not need to be protected where such joints and voids were not required to be protected when the building was originally constructed. Where the system design number is known, the system shall be inspected to the listing criteria and manufacturer’s installation instructions.

704.2 Repair of joints and voids.

Where damaged, materials used to protect joints and voids shall be replaced or restored with materials or systems that meet or exceed the code requirements applicable at the time when the assembly was constructed, remodeled or altered.

704.3 Opening protectives.

Where openings are required to be protected, opening protectives shall be maintained selfclosing or automatic-closing by smoke detection. Existing fusible-link-type automatic door-closing devices are permitted if the fusible link rating does not exceed 135°F (57°C).

SECTION SECTION 705 DOOR AND WINDOW OPENINGS

705.1 General.

Where required when the building was originally constructed, opening protectives installed in fire-resistance-rated assemblies, smoke barriers and smoke partitions shall be inspected and maintained in accordance with this section.
