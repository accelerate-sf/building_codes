CHAPTER 55 CRYOGENIC FLUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 55 regulates the hazards associated with the storage, use and handling of cryogenic fluids through regulation of such things as pressure relief mechanisms and proper container storage. These hazards are in addition to the code requirements that address the other hazards of cryogenic fluids such as flammability and toxicity. These other characteristics are dealt with in  Chapter 50 and other chapters, such as  Chapter 58 and its content about flammable gases. Cryogens are hazardous because they are held at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. Many cryogenic fluids, however, are actually inert gases and would not be regulated elsewhere in this code. Cryogens are used for many applications but specifically have had widespread use in the biomedical field and in space programs.
