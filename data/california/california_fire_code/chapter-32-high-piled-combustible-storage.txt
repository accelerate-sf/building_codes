CHAPTER 32 HIGH-PILED COMBUSTIBLE STORAGE

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 32 provides guidance for reasonable protection of life from hazards associated with the storage of combustible materials in closely packed piles or on pallets, in racks or on shelves where the top of storage is greater than 12 feet in height, or 6 feet for high-hazard commodities. It provides requirements for identifying various classes of commodities; and general fire and life safety features including storage arrangements, smoke and heat venting, fire department access and housekeeping and maintenance. This chapter attempts to define the potential fire severity and, in turn, determine fire and life safety protection measures needed to control and in some cases suppress a potential fire. This chapter does not cover miscellaneous combustible material storage as regulated in Section 315.

SECTION 3203 COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION

3203.1 Classification of commodities.

Commodities shall be classified as Class I, II, III, IV or high hazard in accordance with Sections 3203.2 through 3203.10.3. Materials listed within each commodity classification are assumed to be unmodified for improved combustibility characteristics. Use of flame-retarding modifiers or the physical form of the material could change the classification.

3203.2 Class I commodities.

Class I commodities are noncombustible products in ordinary corrugated cartons with or without single-thickness dividers, or in ordinary paper wrappings with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.3 Class II commodities.

Class II commodities are Class I products in slatted wooden crates, solid wooden boxes, multiple-thickness paperboard cartons or equivalent combustible packaging material with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.4 Class III commodities.

Class III commodities are products of wood, paper, natural fiber cloth, or Group C plastics or products thereof, with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.5 Class IV commodities.

Class IV commodities are Class I, II or III products containing Group A plastics in ordinary corrugated cartons; Class I, II and III products with Group A plastic packaging; Group B plastics; and free-flowing Group A plastics with or without wood pallets. The total amount of nonfree-flowing Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.6 High-hazard commodities.

High-hazard commodities are products presenting special fire hazards beyond those of Class I, II, III or IV. Group A plastics not otherwise classified are included in this class.

3203.7 Classification of plastics.

Plastics shall be designated as Group A, B or C in accordance with Sections 3203.7.1 through 3203.7.3.

3203.7.1 Group A plastics.

Group A plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion that is much higher than that of ordinary combustibles, and a burning rate higher than that of Group B plastics.

3203.7.2 Group B plastics.

Group B plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate higher than that of ordinary combustibles, but not as high as those of Group A plastics.

3203.7.3 Group C plastics.

Group C plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate similar to those of ordinary combustibles.

3203.8 Examples of commodity classification.

Table 3203.8 shall be used to determine the commodity classification for various products and materials. Products not found in the list shall be classified based on the classification descriptions in Sections 3203.2 through 3203.6 and the products they most nearly represent in Table 3203.8. Table 3203.8 considers the product and the packaging if listed with the item. Products with additional packaging consisting of Group A plastics shall be classified in accordance with Section 3203.9.

The commodity classifications are based on products with, or without, wood pallets. Where plastic pallets are used, the commodity classification shall be modified in accordance with Section 3203.10.

3203.9 Limited quantities of Group A plastics in mixed commodities.

Figures 3203.9(1) and 3203.9(2) shall be used to determine the commodity classification based on the quantity of Group A plastics in the following situations:

1.The product is not listed in Table 3203.8 and contains Group A plastics.

2.The commodity contains Group A plastics and is not classified as high hazard in Table 3203.8.

3.The product listing in Table 3203.8 does not specifically include packaging, and the packaging material includes Group A plastics.

FIGURE 3203.9(1)

EVALUATION BY VOLUME OF GROUP A EXPANDED PLASTICS IN MIXED COMMODITIESa, b

a.This figure is used to determine the commodity classification of a mixed commodity with Group A plastics in a package or carton, or on a pallet.

b.The following is an example of how to apply Figure 3203.9(1): A pallet load consists of a Class III commodity with components of unexpanded Group A plastic and packing material of expanded Group A plastic. Using Equation 32-1, the weight of unexpanded Group A plastic is 5 percent. Using Equation 32-2, the volume of expanded Group A plastic is 15 percent. This commodity is classified as a Class IV commodity. If the volume of the expanded Group A plastic is increased to 20 percent, the classification changes to a high-hazard commodity. Compare this result with the result from Figure 3203.9(2), and the highest classification will apply. Where the load is stored on a plastic pallet, the requirements in Section 3203.10 apply.
