CHAPTER 37 COMBUSTIBLE FIBERS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 37 establishes the requirements for storage and handling of combustible fibers, including animal, vegetable and synthetic fibers, whether woven into textiles, baled, packaged or loose. Operations involving combustible fibers are typically associated with salvage, paper milling, recycling, cloth manufacturing, carpet and textile mills and agricultural operations, among others. The primary hazard associated with these operations is the abundance of materials and their ready ignitability.

SECTION 3701 GENERAL

3701.1 Scope.

The equipment, processes and operations involving combustible fibers shall comply with this chapter.

3701.2 Applicability.

Storage of combustible fibers in any quantity shall comply with this section.

3701.3 Permits.

Permits shall be required as set forth in Section 105.5.

SECTION 3702 DEFINITIONS

3702.1 Definitions.

The following terms are defined in Chapter 2:

BALED COTTON.

Hay, straw, seed cotton or similar agricultural products shall not be stored adjacent to structures or combustible materials unless a clear horizontal distance equal to the height of a pile is maintained between such storage and structures or combustible materials. Storage shall be limited to stacks of 100 tons (91 metric tons) each. Stacks shall be separated by not less than 20 feet (6096 mm) of clear space. Quantities of hay, straw, seed cotton and other agricultural products shall not be limited where stored in or near farm structures located outside closely built areas. A permit shall not be required for agricultural storage.

3703.5 Dust collection.

Where located within a building, equipment or machinery that generates or emits combustible fibers shall be provided with an approved dust-collecting and exhaust system. Such systems shall comply with Chapter 22 of this code and Section 511 of the California Mechanical Code.

Smoking shall be prohibited and “No Smoking” signs provided as follows:

1.In rooms or areas where materials are stored or dispensed or used in open systems.

2.Within 25 feet (7620 mm) of outdoor storage or open use areas.

3.Facilities or areas within facilities that have been designated as totally “no smoking” shall have “No Smoking” signs placed at all entrances to the facility or area. Designated areas within such facilities where smoking is permitted either permanently or temporarily shall be identified with signs designating that smoking is permitted in these areas only.

Signs required by this section shall be in English as a primary language or in symbols allowed by this code and shall comply with Section 310.

SECTION 3704 LOOSE FIBER STORAGE

3704.1 General.

Loose combustible fibers, not in suitable bales or packages and stored outdoors in the open, shall comply with Section 2808 of this code. Occupancies involving the indoor storage of loose combustible fibers in amounts exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area as set forth in Section 5003.1 shall comply with Sections 3704.2 through 3704.6.

3704.2 Storage of 100 cubic feet or less.

Loose combustible fibers in quantities of not more than 100 cubic feet (3 m3) located in a structure shall be stored in a metal or metal-lined bin equipped with a self-closing cover.

3704.3 Storage of more than 100 cubic feet to 500 cubic feet.

Loose combustible fibers in quantities exceeding 100 cubic feet (3 m3) but not exceeding 500 cubic feet (14 m3) shall be stored in rooms enclosed with 1-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the California Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the California Building Code, or both, with openings protected by an approved opening protective assembly having a fire protection rating of 3/4 hour in accordance with the California Building Code.

3704.4 Storage of more than 500 cubic feet to 1,000 cubic feet.

Loose combustible fibers in quantities exceeding 500 cubic feet (14 m3) but not exceeding 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3) shall be stored in rooms enclosed with 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the California Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the California Building Code, or both, with openings protected by an approved opening protective assembly having a fire protection rating of 11/2 hours in accordance with the California Building Code.

3704.5 Storage of more than 1,000 cubic feet.

Loose combustible fibers in quantities exceeding 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3) shall be stored in rooms enclosed with 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the California Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the California Building Code, or both, with openings protected by an approved opening protective assembly having a fire protection rating of 11/2 hours in accordance with the California Building Code.
