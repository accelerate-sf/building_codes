APPENDIX L REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE FIGHTERAIR REPLENISHMENT SYSTEMS

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix L provides for the design, installation and maintenance of permanently installed fire fighter breathing air systems in buildings designated by the jurisdiction. Breathing air is critical for fire-fighting operations. Historically, fire departments have supplied air bottles by means of a “bottle brigade,” whereby fire fighters manually transport air bottles up stairways, which is an extraordinarily fire fighter-intensive process and takes fire fighters away from their primary mission of rescue and fire fighting. Technology now exists to address the issue using in-building air supply systems. Fire fighter breathing air systems were introduced in the late 1980s and are now required in a number of communities throughout the United States. The system has been called a “standpipe for air” and consists of stainless steel, high-pressure piping that is supplied by on-site air storage or fire department air supply units. Air-filling stations are then strategically located throughout the building, allowing fire fighters to refill breathing air cylinders inside the fire building, negating the required “bottle brigade,” and making more fire fighters available for search, rescue and fire suppression operations.

SECTION L101 GENERAL

L101.1 Scope.

Fire fighter air replenishment systems (FARS) shall be provided in accordance with this appendix. The adopting ordinance shall specify building characteristics or special hazards that establish thresholds triggering a requirement for the installation of a FARS. The requirement shall be based on the fire department’s capability of replenishing fire fighter breathing air during sustained emergency operations. Considerations shall include:

1.Building characteristics, such as number of stories above or below grade plane, floor area, type of construction and fire resistance of the primary structural frame to allow sustained fire-fighting operations based on a rating of not less than 2 hours.

2.Special hazards, other than buildings, that require unique accommodations to allow the fire department to replenish fire fighter breathing air.

3.Fire department staffing level.

4.Availability of a fire department breathing air replenishment vehicle.

SECTION L102 DEFINITIONS
