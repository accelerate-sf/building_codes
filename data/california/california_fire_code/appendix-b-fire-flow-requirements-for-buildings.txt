APPENDIX B FIRE-FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix B provides a tool for the use of jurisdictions in establishing a policy for determining fire-flow requirements in accordance with Section 507.3. The determination of required fire flow is not an exact science, but having some level of information provides a consistent way of choosing the appropriate fire flow for buildings throughout a jurisdiction. The primary tool used in this appendix is a table that presents fire flow based on construction type and building area based on the correlation of the Insurance Services Office (ISO) method and the construction types used in the International Building Code®.

SECTION B101 GENERAL

B101.1 Scope.

The procedure for determining fire-flow requirements for buildings or portions of buildings hereafter constructed shall be in accordance with this appendix. This appendix does not apply to structures other than buildings.

SECTION B102 DEFINITIONS

B102.1 Definitions.

For the purpose of this appendix, certain terms are defined as follows:

FIRE FLOW. The flow rate of a water supply, measured at 20 pounds per square inch (psi) (138 kPa) residual pressure, that is available for fire fighting.

FIRE-FLOW CALCULATION AREA. The floor area, in square feet (m2), used to determine the required fire flow.

SECTION B103 MODIFICATIONS

B103.1 Decreases.

The fire code official is authorized to reduce the fire-flow requirements for isolated buildings or a group of buildings in rural areas or small communities where the development of full fire-flow requirements is impractical.

B103.2 Increases.

The fire code official is authorized to increase the fire-flow requirements where conditions indicate an unusual susceptibility to group fires or conflagrations. An increase shall be not more than twice that required for the building under consideration.

B103.3 Areas without water supply systems.

For information regarding water supplies for fire-fighting purposes in rural and suburban areas in which adequate and reliable water supply systems do not exist, the fire code official is authorized to utilize NFPA 1142.



SECTION B104 FIRE-FLOW CALCULATION AREA

B104.1 General.

The fire-flow calculation area shall be the total floor area of all floor levels within the exterior walls, and under the horizontal projections of the roof of a building, except as modified in Section B104.3.

B104.2 Area separation.

Portions of buildings that are separated by fire walls without openings, constructed in accordance with the California Building Code, are allowed to be considered as separate fire-flow calculation areas.

B104.3 Type IA and Type IB construction.

The fire-flow calculation area of buildings constructed of Type IA and Type IB construction shall be the area of the three largest successive floors.

Exception: Fire-flow calculation area for open parking garages shall be determined by the area of the largest floor.

SECTION B105 FIRE-FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS

B105.1 One- and two-family dwellings, Group R-3 and R-4 buildings and townhouses.

The minimum fire-flow and flow duration requirements for one- and two-family dwellings, Group R-3 and R-4 buildings and townhouses shall be as specified in Tables B105.1(1) and B105.1(2).
