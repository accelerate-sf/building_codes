CHAPTER 4 EMERGENCY PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 4 addresses the human contribution to life safety in buildings when a fire or other emergency occurs. The requirements for continuous training and scheduled fire, evacuation and lockdown drills can be as important as the required periodic inspections and maintenance of built-in fire protection features. The level of preparation by the occupants also improves the emergency responders’ abilities during an emergency. The California Building Code focuses on built-in fire protection features, such as automatic sprinkler systems, fire-resistance-rated construction and properly designed egress systems, whereas this chapter fully addresses the human element.
