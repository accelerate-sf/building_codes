CHAPTER 34 TIRE REBUILDING AND TIRE STORAGE

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 34 provides requirements that are intended to prevent or control fires and explosions associated with the remanufacture and storage of tires and tire byproducts. Additionally, the requirements are intended to minimize the impact of indoor and outdoor tire storage fires by regulating pile volume and location, segregating the various operations, providing for fire department access and a water supply, and controlling ignition sources.
