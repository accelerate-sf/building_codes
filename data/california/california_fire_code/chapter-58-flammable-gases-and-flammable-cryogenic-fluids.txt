CHAPTER 58 FLAMMABLE GASES AND FLAMMABLE CRYOGENIC FLUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 58 sets requirements for the storage and use of flammable gases. For safety purposes, there is a limit on the quantities of flammable gas allowed per control area. Exceeding these limitations increases the possibility of damage to both property and individuals. The principal hazard posed by flammable gas is its ready ignitability, or even explosivity, when mixed with air in the proper proportions. Consequently, occupancies storing or handling large quantities of flammable gas are classified as Group H-2 (high hazard) by the California Building Code.
