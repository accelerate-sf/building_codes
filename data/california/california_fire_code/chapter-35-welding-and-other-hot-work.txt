CHAPTER 35 WELDING AND OTHER HOT WORK

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 35 covers requirements for safety in welding and other types of hot work by reducing the potential for fire ignitions that usually result in large losses. Several different types of hot work would fall under the requirements found in Chapter 35, including both gas and electric arc methods and any open-torch operations. Many of the activities of this chapter focus on the actions of the occupants.
