CHAPTER 57 FLAMMABLE AND COMBUSTIBLE LIQUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 57 provides requirements that are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage, handling, use or transportation of flammable and combustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. These liquids are used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable and combustible liquids is that the vapors from these liquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environments. The regulations herein are intended to prevent the flammable and combustible liquids from being ignited and provide mitigating requirements for when a fire does occur.

SECTION 5701 GENERAL

3.Quantities of alcoholic beverages in retail or wholesale sales or storage occupancies, provided that the liquids are packaged in individual containers not exceeding 1.3 gallons (5 L).

4.Storage and use of fuel oil in tanks and containers connected to oil-burning equipment. Such storage and use shall be in accordance with Section 605. For abandonment of fuel oil tanks, this chapter applies.

9.Liquids without flash points that can be flammable under some conditions, such as certain halogenated hydrocarbons and mixtures containing halogenated hydrocarbons.

10.The storage of beer, distilled spirits and wines in barrels and casks.

11.Commercial cooking oil storage tank systems located within a building and designed and installed in accordance with Section 607 and NFPA 30.

12.Application and release of pesticide and agricultural products and materials intended for use in weed abatement, erosion control, soil amendment or similar applications where applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and label directions.

13.The off-site transportation of flammable or combustible liquids where in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOTn) regulation.
