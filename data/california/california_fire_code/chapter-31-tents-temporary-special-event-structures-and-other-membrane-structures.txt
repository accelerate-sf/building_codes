CHAPTER 31 TENTS, TEMPORARY SPECIAL EVENT STRUCTURES AND OTHER MEMBRANE STRUCTURES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 31 provides requirements that are intended to protect temporary as well as permanent tents and air-supported and other membrane structures and temporary stage special event structures from fire and similar hazards. The provisions regulate structure location and access, anchorage, egress, heat-producing equipment, hazardous materials and operations, combustible vegetation, ignition sources, and waste accumulation. This is accomplished through requiring regular inspections and certifying continued compliance with fire safety regulations. This chapter also addresses outdoor assembly events, which are not limited to those events with tents or other membrane structures, but are regulated due to the number of people, density of those people and hazards associated with large outdoor events related to egress, fire hazards from cooking and other related concerns.
