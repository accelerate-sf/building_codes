CHAPTER 62 ORGANIC PEROXIDES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 62 addresses the hazards associated with the storage, handling and use of organic peroxides and is intended to manage the fire and oxidation hazards of organic peroxides by preventing their uncontrolled release. These chemicals possess the characteristics of flammable or combustible liquids and are also strong oxidizers. This unusual combination of properties requires special storage and handling precautions to prevent uncontrolled release, contamination, hazardous chemical reactions, fires or explosions. The requirements of this chapter pertain to industrial applications in which significant quantities of organic peroxides are stored or used; however, smaller quantities of organic peroxides still pose a significant hazard and, therefore, must be stored and used in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter and Chapter 50.
