Example of filing fee to accompany application:
Estimated project cost = $250,000.00		
.005 × $250,000.00	=	$1,250.00
Estimated project cost = $1,500,000.00		
.005 × $500,000.00	=	$2,500.00
.0025 × $1,000,000.00	=	2,500.00
		$5,000.00
Estimated project cost = $5,000,000.00		
.005 × $500,000.00	=	$2,500.00
.0025 × $1,500,000.00	=	3,750.00
.001 × $3,000,000.00	=	3,000.00
		$9,250.00(b)The fee schedule in effect at the time of filing shall apply throughout the duration of such application.

(c)When the actual project cost exceeds the estimated cost a further fee for such projects shall become due and shall be equal to the difference between the filing fee paid and the amount computed under the schedule above using the actual cost of the project. The actual project cost shall be determined as directed in Section 5-105 and billed according to Section 5-107.

(d)If the applicant requests the cancellation or withdrawal of the application and return of the plans and specifications and filing fee, this shall be granted unless the review has begun. No portion of the filing fee can be returned after the review has started.

(e)Beginning in July 2009, with a review in 2011 and within every four years thereafter, the State Architect shall review the fee schedule and make a written determination whether the fees are sufficient to fund the programs.

(i)If the State Architect determines that a lesser amount is sufficient to maintain the programs, the fees may be reduced for a period up to four years.

(ii)If the State Architect determines that a greater amount is necessary to maintain the programs utilizing these funds, the State Architect shall propose a fee schedule increase.
