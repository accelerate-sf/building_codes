The 2022 California Building Standards Code (Code) was developed through the outstanding collaborative efforts of the Department of Housing and Community Development, Division of State Architect, Office of the State Fire Marshal, Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, California Energy Commission, California Department of Public Health, California State Lands Commission, Board of State and Community Corrections, and the California Building Standards Commission (Commission).

This collaborative effort included the assistance of the Commission’s Code Advisory Committees and many other volunteers who worked tirelessly to assist the Commission in the production of this Code.
