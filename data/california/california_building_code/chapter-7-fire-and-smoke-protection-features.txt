CHAPTER 7 FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides detailed requirements for fire-resistance-rated construction, including structural members, walls, partitions and horizontal assemblies. Other portions of the code describe where certain fire-resistance-rated elements are required. This chapter specifies how these elements are constructed, how openings in walls and partitions are protected and how penetrations of such elements are protected.

SECTION 701 GENERAL

701.1 Scope

The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, systems and assemblies used for structural fire resistance and fire-resistance-rated construction separation of adjacent spaces to safeguard against the spread of fire and smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from buildings.

SECTION 702 MULTIPLE-USE FIRE ASSEMBLIES

702.1 Multiple-use fire assemblies

Fire assemblies that serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all of the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual fire assemblies.

SECTION 703 FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS

703.1 Scope

Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.

703.2 Fire resistance.

The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with Section 703.2.1 or 703.2.2 without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppression system being incorporated, or in accordance with Section 703.2.3.

703.2.1 Tested assemblies.

A fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263. The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant joint systems shall be determined in accordance with Sections 714 and 715, respectively.

703.2.1.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction.

Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior walls).

703.2.1.2 Combustible components

Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.

703.2.1.3 Restrained classification

Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the construction documents.

703.2.1.4 Supplemental features

Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the building official to show that the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced.

703.2.1.5 Exterior bearing walls

In determining the fire-resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required fire-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same group. Where the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this section.

703.2.2 Analytical methods.

The fire resistance of building elements, components or assemblies established by an analytical method shall be by any of the methods listed in this section, based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E119 or UL 263.

1.Fire-resistance designs documented in approved sources.

2.Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies as prescribed in Section 721.

3.Calculations in accordance with Section 722.

4.Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building element, component or assemblies designs having fire-resistance ratings as determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263.

703.2.3 Approved alternate method.

The fire resistance of building elements, components or assemblies not complying with Section 703.2.1 or 703.2.2 shall be permitted to be established by an alternative protection method in accordance with Section 104.11.

703.3 Noncombustibility tests.

The tests indicated in Section 703.3.1 shall serve as criteria for acceptance of building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2, 602.3 and 602.4 in Types I, II, III and IV construction. The term “noncombustible” does not apply to the flame spread characteristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not be classified as a noncombustible building construction material if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame spread beyond the limitations herein established through the effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions.

703.3.1 Noncombustible materials.

Materials required to be noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E136. Alternately, materials required to be noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E2652 using the acceptance criteria prescribed by ASTM E136.

Exception: Materials having a structural base of noncombustible material as determined in accordance with ASTM E136, or with ASTM E2652 using the acceptance criteria prescribed by ASTM E136, with a surfacing of not more than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) in thickness having a flame spread index not greater than 50 when tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723 shall be acceptable as noncombustible.



703.4 Fire-resistance-rated glazing.

Fire-resistance-rated glazing, when tested in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263 and complying with the requirements of Section 707, shall be permitted. Fire-resistance-rated glazing shall bear a label marked in accordance with Table 716.1(1) issued by an agency and shall be permanently identified on the glazing.



703.5 Marking and identification.

Where there is an accessible concealed floor, floor-ceiling or attic space, fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, smoke barriers and smoke partitions or any other wall required to have protected openings or penetrations shall be effectively and permanently identified with signs or stenciling in the concealed space. Such identification shall:

1.Be located within 15 feet (4572 mm) of the end of each wall and at intervals not exceeding 30 feet (9144 mm) measured horizontally along the wall or partition.

2.Include lettering not less than 3 inches (76 mm) in height with a minimum 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) stroke in a contrasting color incorporating the suggested wording, “FIRE AND/OR SMOKE BARRIER—PROTECT ALL OPENINGS,” or other wording.

703.6 Determination of noncombustible protection time contribution.

The time, in minutes, contributed to the fireresistance rating by the noncombustible protection of mass timber building elements, components, or assemblies, shall be established through a comparison of assemblies tested using procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263. The test assemblies shall be identical in construction, loading and materials, other than the noncombustible protection. The two test assemblies shall be tested to the same criteria of structural failure with the following conditions:

1.Test Assembly 1 shall be without protection.

2.Test Assembly 2 shall include the representative noncombustible protection. The protection shall be fully defined in terms of configuration details, attachment details, joint sealing details, accessories and all other relevant details.

The noncombustible protection time contribution shall be determined by subtracting the fire-resistance time, in minutes, of Test Assembly 1 from the fire-resistance time, in minutes, of Test Assembly 2.

703.7 Sealing of adjacent mass timber elements.

In buildings of Types IV-A, IV-B and IV-C construction, sealant or adhesive shall be provided to resist the passage of air in the following locations:

1.At abutting edges and intersections of mass timber building elements required to be fire-resistance rated.

2.At abutting intersections of mass timber building elements and building elements of other materials where both are required to be fire-resistance rated.

The fire-resistance rating for wall panels consisting of two or more wythes shall be permitted to be determined by the formula:

where:

R = The fire endurance of the assembly, minutes.

R1, R2, and Rn = The fire endurances of the individual wythes, minutes. Values of Rn0.59 for use in Equation 7-4 are given in Table 722.2.1.2(1). Calculated fire-resistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2.1.2(2).

722.2.1.2.2 Foam plastic insulation

722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side

Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.

The fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.

Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separation distance greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.

722.2.1.4.4 Minimum concrete fire-resistance rating

Where finishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.

1.Structural steel column, either wide flange or tubular shapes.

2.15/8-inch deep studs fabricated from 0.0179-inch minimum thickness galvanized steel with 15/16 or 17/16-inch legs. The length of the steel studs shall be 1/2 inch less than the height of the assembly.

3.Type X gypsum board or gypsum panel products in accordance with ASTM C1177, C1178, C1278, C1396 or C1658. The total thickness of gypsum board or gypsum panel products calculated as h in Section 722.5.1.2 shall be applied vertically to an individual column using one of the following methods:

1.As a single layer without horizontal joints.

2.As multiple layers with horizontal joints not permitted in any layer.

3.As multiple layers with horizontal joints staggered not less than 12 inches vertically between layers and not less than 8 feet vertically in any single layer. The total required thickness of gypsum board or gypsum panel products shall be determined on the basis of the specified fire-resistance rating and the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the column.

4.Galvanized 0.0149-inch minimum thickness steel corner beads with 11/2-inch legs attached to the gypsum board or gypsum panel products with 1-inch-long Type S screws spaced 12 inches on center.

5.No. 18 SWG steel tie wires spaced 24 inches on center.

6.Sheet metal angles with 2-inch legs fabricated from 0.0221-inch minimum thickness galvanized steel.

7.Type S screws, 1 inch long, shall be used for attaching the first layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs and the third layer to the sheet metal angles at 24 inches on center. Type S screws 13/4 inches long shall be used for attaching the second layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs and the fourth layer to the sheet metal angles at 12 inches on center. Type S screws 21/4 inches long shall be used for attaching the third layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs at 12 inches on center.

722.5.1.1 General

These procedures establish a basis for determining the fire resistance of column assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material, and the weight, W, and heated perimeter, D, of structural steel columns. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel column in pounds per linear foot. The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(1).

722.5.1.1.2 Embedments

In the absence of substantiating fire-endurance test results, ducts, conduit, piping, and similar mechanical, electrical, and plumbing installations shall not be embedded in any required fire-resistant materials.

722.5.1.1.3 Weight-to-perimeter ratio

Table 722.5.1(1) contains weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) for both contour and box fire-resistant profiles, for the wide flange shapes most often used as columns.

722.5.1.2.2 Gypsum wallboard equivalent to concrete

The determination of the fire resistance of structural steel columns from Figure 722.5.1(4) is permitted for various thicknesses of gypsum wallboard as a function of the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the column. For structural steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) greater than 3.65, the thickness of gypsum wallboard required for specified fire-resistance ratings shall be the same as the thickness determined for a W14 × 233 wide flange shape.

722.5.1.3 Sprayed fire-resistant materials

The fire resistance of wide-flange structural steel columns protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials, as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(5), shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:

where:

R = Fire resistance (minutes).

h = Thickness of sprayed fire-resistant material (inches).

D = Heated perimeter of the structural steel column (inches).

C1 and C2  = Material-dependent constants.

W = Weight of structural steel columns (pounds per linear foot).

722.5.1.3.1 Material-dependent constants

The material-dependent constants, C1 and C2, shall be determined for specific fire-resistant materials on the basis of standard fire endurance tests in accordance with Section 703.2. Unless evidence is submitted to the building official substantiating a broader application, this expression shall be limited to determining the fire resistance of structural steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) between the largest and smallest columns for which standard fire-resistance test results are available.

722.5.1.3.2 Identification

Sprayed fire-resistant materials shall be identified by density and thickness required for a given fire-resistance rating.

722.5.1.4 Concrete-protected columns

The fire resistance of structural steel columns protected with concrete, as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(6) illustrations (a) and (b), shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:

where:

As used in these expressions:

R = Fire endurance at equilibrium moisture conditions (minutes).

Ro = Fire endurance at zero moisture content (minutes).

m = Equilibrium moisture content of the concrete by volume (percent).

W = Average weight of the structural steel column (pounds per linear foot).

D = Heated perimeter of the structural steel column (inches).

h =  Thickness of the concrete cover (inches).

kc = Ambient temperature thermal conductivity of the concrete (Btu/hr ft °F).

H = Ambient temperature thermal capacity of the steel column = 0.11W (Btu/ ft °F).

pc = Concrete density (pounds per cubic foot).

cc = Ambient temperature specific heat of concrete (Btu/lb °F).

L = Interior dimension of one side of a square concrete box protection (inches).

722.5.1.4.1 Reentrant space filled

For wide-flange structural steel columns completely encased in concrete with all reentrant spaces filled Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (c), the thermal capacity of the concrete within the reentrant spaces shall be permitted to be added to the thermal capacity of the steel column, as follows:

where:

bf = Flange width of the structural steel column (inches).

d = Depth of the structural steel column (inches).

As = Cross-sectional area of the steel column (square inches).

722.5.1.4.2 Concrete properties unknown

If specific data on the properties of concrete are not available, the values given in Table 722.5.1(2) are permitted.

722.5.1.4.3 Minimum concrete cover

For structural steel column encased in concrete with all reentrant spaces filled, Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (c) and Tables 722.5.1(7) and 722.5.1(8) indicate the thickness of concrete cover required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical wide-flange sections. The thicknesses of concrete indicated in these tables apply to structural steel columns larger than those specified.

722.5.1.4.4 Minimum precast concrete cover

For structural steel columns protected with precast concrete column covers as shown in Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (a), Tables 722.5.1(9) and 722.5.1(10) indicate the thickness of the column covers required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical wide-flange shapes. The thicknesses of concrete given in these tables apply to structural steel columns larger than those specified.

722.5.1.4.5 Masonry protection

The fire resistance of structural steel columns protected with concrete masonry units or clay masonry units as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(7) shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:

W = Average weight of structural steel column (pounds per foot).

D = Heated perimeter of structural steel column (inches) [see Figure 722.5.1(7)].

Te = Equivalent thickness of concrete or clay masonry unit (inches) (see Table 722.3.2, Note a or Section 722.4.1).

K = Thermal conductivity of concrete or clay masonry unit (Btu/hr × ft × °F) [see Table 722.5.1(3)].

As = Cross-sectional area of structural steel column (square inches).

dm = Density of the concrete or clay masonry unit (pounds per cubic foot).

p = Inner perimeter of concrete or clay masonry protection (inches) [see Figure 722.5.1(7)].

722.5.1.4.6 Equivalent concrete masonry thickness

For structural steel columns protected with concrete masonry, Table 722.5.1(5) gives the equivalent thickness of concrete masonry required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical column shapes. For structural steel columns protected with clay masonry, Table 722.5.1(6) gives the equivalent thickness of concrete masonry required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical column shapes.

722.5.2 Structural steel beams and girders

The fire-resistance ratings of structural steel beams and girders shall be based on the size of the element and the type of protection provided in accordance with this section.

FIGURE 722.5.2

DETERMINATION OF THE HEATED PERIMETER OF STRUCTURAL STEEL BEAMS AND GIRDERS

722.5.2.1 Determination of fire resistance

These procedures establish a basis for determining resistance of structural steel beams and girders that differ in size from that specified in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material and the weight (W) and heated perimeter (D) of the beam or girder. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel element in pounds per linear foot (plf). The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.2.

722.5.2.1.1 Weight-to-heated perimeter

The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D), for both contour and box fire-resistant protection profiles, for the wide flange shapes most often used as beams or girders are given in Table 722.5.1(4). For different shapes, the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) shall be determined in accordance with the definitions given in this section.

722.5.2.1.2 Beam and girder substitutions

Except as provided for in Section 722.5.2.2, structural steel beams in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies shall be considered to be the minimum permissible size. Other beam or girder shapes shall be permitted to be substituted provided that the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the substitute beam is equal to or greater than that of the beam specified in the approved assembly.

722.5.2.2 Sprayed fire-resistant materials

The provisions in this section apply to structural steel beams and girders protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials. Larger or smaller beam and girder shapes shall be permitted to be substituted for beams specified in approved unrestrained or restrained fire-resistance-rated assemblies, provided that the thickness of the fire-resistant material is adjusted in accordance with the following expression:

where:

h = Thickness of sprayed fire-resistant material in inches.

W = Weight of the structural steel beam or girder in pounds per linear foot.
