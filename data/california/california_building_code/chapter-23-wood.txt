CHAPTER 23 WOOD

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 23 provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and structures that use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and conventional light-frame construction. In addition it allows the use of the American Wood Council Wood Frame Construction Manual for a limited range of structures. Included in the chapter are references to design and manufacturing standards for various wood and wood-based products; general construction requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the application of the three design methods.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

a.Spans are given in feet and inches.

b.Spans are based on minimum design properties for No. 2 grade lumber of Douglas fir-larch, hem-fir, Southern pine and spruce-pine fir.

c.Building width is measured perpendicular to the ridge. For widths between those shown, spans are permitted to be interpolated.

d.NJ = Number of jack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required jack studs equals one, the header is permitted to be supported by an approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.

e.Use 30 psf ground snow load for cases in which ground snow load is less than 30 psf and the roof live load is equal to or less than 20 psf.

f.Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally braced (for example, cripple studs bearing on the header), tabulated spans for headers consisting of 2 × 8, 2 × 10, or 2 × 12 sizes shall be multiplied by 0.70 or the header or girder shall be designed.

a.The tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward push of the rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter spans shall be multiplied by the adjustment factors in Table 2308.7.2(7).

b.Span exceeds 26 feet in length.

c.The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load.

d.The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads found in the table. The overhang loads are based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projection and added to the roof uplift value in the table.

e.The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.5-1 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8.

f.For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down).

g.Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans.

h.The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications.

i.Vasd shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1.

2308.7.6 Framing around openings.

Trimmer and header rafters shall be doubled, or of lumber of equivalent cross section, where the span of the header exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). The ends of header rafters that are more than 6 feet (1829 mm) in length shall be supported by framing anchors or rafter hangers unless bearing on a beam, partition or wall.

2308.7.6.1 Openings in roof diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D and E.

In buildings classified as Seismic Design Category B, C, D or E. openings in horizontal diaphragms with a dimension that is greater than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall be constructed with metal ties and blocking in accordance with this section and Figure 2308.4.4.1(1). Metal ties shall be not less than 0.058 inch [1.47 mm (16 galvanized gage)] in thickness by 11/2 inches (38 mm) in width and shall have a yield stress not less than 33,000 psi (227 Mpa). Blocking shall extend not less than the dimension of the opening in the direction of the tie and blocking. Ties shall be attached to blocking in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions but with not less than eight 16d common nails on each side of the header-joist intersection.

2308.7.7 Purlins.

Purlins to support roof loads are permitted to be installed to reduce the span of rafters within allowable limits and shall be supported by struts to bearing walls. The maximum span of 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) purlins shall be 4 feet (1219 mm). The maximum span of the 2-inch by 6-inch (51 mm by 152 mm) purlin shall be 6 feet (1829 mm), but the purlin shall not be smaller than the supported rafter. Struts shall be not less than 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) members. The unbraced length of struts shall not exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) and the slope of the struts shall be not less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal.
