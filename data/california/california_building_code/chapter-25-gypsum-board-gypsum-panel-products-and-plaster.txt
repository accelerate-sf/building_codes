CHAPTER 25 GYPSUM BOARD, GYPSUM PANEL PRODUCTS AND PLASTER

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 25 contains the provisions and referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum board, gypsum panel products and plaster and, in addition, addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These materials are some of the most commonly used interior and exterior finish materials in the building industry. This chapter primarily addresses quality-control-related issues with regard to material specifications and installation requirements. Most products are manufactured in accordance with industry standards. The building official or inspector needs to verify that the appropriate product is used and properly installed for the intended use and location. Proper design and installation of these materials are necessary to provide weather resistance and required fire protection for both structural and nonstructural building components.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

The weep screed shall be placed not less than 4 inches (102 mm) above the earth or 2 inches (51 mm) above paved areas and be of a type that will allow trapped water to drain to the exterior of the building. The water-resistive barrier shall lap the attachment flange. The exterior lath shall cover and terminate on the attachment flange of the weep screed.

2512.2 Plasticity agents.

Only approved plasticity agents and approved amounts thereof shall be added to Portland cement or blended cements. Where plastic cement or masonry cement is used, additional lime or plasticizers shall not be added. Hydrated lime or the equivalent amount of lime putty used as a plasticizer is permitted to be added to cement plaster or cement and lime plaster in an amount not to exceed that set forth in ASTM C926.

2512.3 Limitations.

Gypsum plaster shall not be used on exterior surfaces.

2512.4 Cement plaster.

Plaster coats shall be protected from freezing for a period of not less than 24 hours after set has occurred. Plaster shall be applied when the ambient temperature is higher than 40°F (4°C), unless provisions are made to keep cement plaster work above 40°F (4°C) during application and 48 hours thereafter.

2512.5 Second-coat application.

The second coat shall be brought out to proper thickness, rodded and floated sufficiently rough to provide adequate bond for the finish coat. The second coat shall not have variations greater than 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) in any direction under a 5-foot (1524 mm) straight edge.

2512.6 Curing and interval.

First and second coats of cement plaster shall be applied and moist cured as set forth in ASTM C926 and Table 2512.6.

TABLE 2512.6

CEMENT PLASTERS

COAT	MINIMUM PERIODMOIST CURING	MINIMUM INTERVALBETWEEN COATS
First	48 hoursa	48 hoursb
Second	48 hours	7 daysc
Finish	—	Note ca.The first two coats shall be as required for the first coats of exterior plaster, except that the moist-curing time period between the first and second coats shall be not less than 24 hours. Moist curing shall not be required where job and weather conditions are favorable to the retention of moisture in the cement plaster for the required time period.

b.Twenty-four-hour minimum interval between coats of interior cement plaster. For alternative method of application, see Section 2512.8.

c.Finish coat plaster is permitted to be applied to interior cement plaster base coats after a 48-hour period.

2512.7 Application to solid backings.

Where applied over gypsum backing as specified in Section 2510.5 or directly to unit masonry surfaces, the second coat is permitted to be applied as soon as the first coat has attained sufficient hardness.

2512.8 Alternate method of application.

The second coat is permitted to be applied as soon as the first coat has attained sufficient rigidity to receive the second coat.

2512.8.1 Admixtures.

Where using this method of application, calcium aluminate cement up to 15 percent of the weight of the Portland cement is permitted to be added to the mix.

2512.8.2 Curing.

Curing of the first coat is permitted to be omitted and the second coat shall be cured as set forth in ASTM C926 and Table 2512.6.

2512.9 Finish coats.

Cement plaster finish coats shall be applied over base coats that have been in place for the time periods set forth in ASTM C926. The third or finish coat shall be applied with sufficient material and pressure to bond and to cover the brown coat and shall be of sufficient thickness to conceal the brown coat.

SECTION 2513 EXPOSED AGGREGATE PLASTER

2513.1 General.

Exposed natural or integrally colored aggregate is permitted to be partially embedded in a natural or colored bedding coat of cement plaster or gypsum plaster, subject to the provisions of this section.

2513.2 Aggregate.

The aggregate shall be applied manually or mechanically and shall consist of marble chips, pebbles or similar durable, moderately hard (three or more on the Mohs hardness scale), nonreactive materials.

2513.3 Bedding coat proportions.

The bedding coat for interior or exterior surfaces shall be composed of one part Portland cement and one part Type S lime; or one part blended cement and one part Type S lime; or masonry cement; or plastic cement and not more than three parts of graded white or natural sand by volume. The bedding coat for interior surfaces shall be composed of 100 pounds (45.4 kg) of neat gypsum plaster and not more than 200 pounds (90.8 kg) of graded white sand. A factory-prepared bedding coat for interior or exterior use is permitted. The bedding coat for exterior surfaces shall have a minimum compressive strength of 1,000 pounds per square inch (6895 kPa).

2513.4 Application.

The bedding coat is permitted to be applied directly over the first (scratch) coat of plaster, provided that the ultimate overall thickness is not less than 7/8 inch (22 mm), including lath. Over concrete or masonry surfaces, the overall thickness shall be not less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm).

2513.5 Bases.

Exposed aggregate plaster is permitted to be applied over concrete, masonry, cement plaster base coats or gypsum plaster base coats installed in accordance with Section 2511 or 2512.

2513.6 Preparation of masonry and concrete.

Masonry and concrete surfaces shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 2510.7.

2513.7 Curing of base coats.

Cement plaster base coats shall be cured in accordance with ASTM C926. Cement plaster bedding coats shall retain sufficient moisture for hydration (hardening) for 24 hours minimum or, where necessary, shall be kept damp for 24 hours by light water spraying.

SECTION 2514 REINFORCED GYPSUM CONCRETE

2514.1 General.

Reinforced gypsum concrete shall comply with the requirements of ASTM C317 and ASTM C956.

Exception: [DSA-SS and OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 4 & 5] Reinforced gypsum concrete shall be considered as an alternative system, except for [OSHPD 2] single-story Type V skilled nursing or intermediate care facilities utilizing wood-frame or light-steel-frame construction.

2514.2 Minimum thickness.

The minimum thickness of reinforced gypsum concrete shall be 2 inches (51 mm) except the minimum required thickness shall be reduced to 11/2 inches (38 mm), provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

1.The overall thickness, including the formboard, is not less than 2 inches (51 mm).

2.The clear span of the gypsum concrete between supports does not exceed 33 inches (838 mm).

3.Diaphragm action is not required.

4.The design live load does not exceed 40 pounds per square foot (psf) (1915 Pa).
