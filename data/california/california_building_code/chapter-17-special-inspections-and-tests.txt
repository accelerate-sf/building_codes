CHAPTER 17 SPECIAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing materials and assemblies, and labeling materials and assemblies. Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To determine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle.
