Minimum standards for wall covering materials, such as material performance and fire resistance, installation of wall coverings and the ability of the wall to provide weather protection are provided. This chapter also contains limitations on the areas and heights of combustible wall coverings based on fire separation distances, radiant heat exposure and surface burning characteristics.

1408.11.1 Installations up to 40 feet in height.

HPL shall be permitted to be installed up to 40 feet (12 190 mm) in height above grade plane where installed in accordance with Section 1408.11.1.1 or 1408.11.1.2.

1408.11.1.1 Fire separation distance of 5 feet or less.

Where the fire separation distance is 5 feet (1524 mm) or less, the area of HPL shall not exceed 10 percent of the exterior wall surface.

1408.11.1.2 Fire separation distance greater than 5 feet.

Where the fire separation distance is greater than 5 feet (1524 mm), the area of exterior wall surface coverage using HPL shall not be limited.



1408.12 Type V construction.

HPL shall be permitted to be installed on buildings of Type V construction.

1408.13 Foam plastic insulation.

HPL systems containing foam plastic insulation shall comply with the requirements of Section 2603.

SECTION 1410 [DSA-SS & DSA-SS/CC, OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 4 & 5] ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANCHORED AND ADHERED VENEER [DSA-SS & DSA-SS/CC, OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 4 & 5] ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANCHORED AND ADHERED VENEER

1410.1 General.

In no case shall veneer be considered as part of the backing in computing strength or deflection nor shall it be considered a part of the required thickness of the backing.

Veneer shall be anchored in a manner which will not allow relative movement between the veneer and the wall.

Anchored or adhered veneer shall not be used on overhead horizontal surfaces.

1410.2 Adhered veneer.

Units of tile, masonry, stone or terra cotta which exceed 5/8 inch (16 mm) in thickness shall be applied as for anchored veneer where used over exit ways or more than 20 feet (6096 mm) in height above adjacent ground elevation.

1410.2.1 Bond strength and tests.

Veneer shall develop a bond to the backing in accordance with TMS 402, Section 12.3.2.4.

Not less than two shear tests shall be performed for the adhered veneer between the units and the supporting element. At least one shear test shall be performed at each building for each 5,000 square feet (465 m2) of floor area or fraction thereof.
