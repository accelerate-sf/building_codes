CHAPTER 20 ALUMINUM

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 20 contains standards for the use of aluminum in building construction. Only the structural applications of aluminum are addressed so it would not apply to the use of aluminum in specialty products such as storefront or window framing or architectural hardware. The use of aluminum in heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems is addressed in the California Mechanical Code®. This chapter references national standards from the Aluminum Association for use of aluminum in building construction, AA ASM 35, Aluminum Sheet Metal Work in Building Construction, and AA ADM, Aluminum Design Manual.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
