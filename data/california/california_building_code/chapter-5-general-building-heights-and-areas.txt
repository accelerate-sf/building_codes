CHAPTER 5 GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 5 establishes the limits to which a building can be built. Building height, number of stories and building area are specified in this chapter. Chapter 5 must be used in conjunction with the occupancies established in Chapter 3 and the types of construction established in Chapter 6. This chapter also specifies the impact that mezzanines, accessory occupancies and mixed occupancies have on the overall size of a building.

SECTION 501 GENERAL

501.1 Scope

The provisions of this chapter control the height and area of structures hereafter erected and additions to existing structures.

SECTION 502 BUILDING ADDRESS

[F] 502.1 Address identification

New and existing buildings shall be provided with approved address identification. The address identification shall be legible and placed in a position that is visible from the street or road fronting the property. Address identification characters shall contrast with their background. Address numbers shall be Arabic numbers or alphabetical letters. Numbers shall not be spelled out. Each character shall be a minimum of 4 inches (102 mm) high with a minimum stroke width of 1/2 inch (12.7 mm). Where required by the fire code official, address identification shall be provided in additional approved locations to facilitate emergency response. Where access is by means of a private road and the building address cannot be viewed from the public way, a monument, pole or other approved sign or means shall be used to identify the structure. Address identification shall be maintained.

SECTION 503 GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHT AND AREA LIMITATIONS

503.1 General

Unless otherwise specifically modified in Chapter 4 and this chapter, building height, number of stories and building area shall not exceed the limits specified in Sections 504 and 506 based on the type of construction as determined by Section 602 and the occupancies as determined by Section 302 except as modified hereafter. Building height, number of stories and building area provisions shall be applied independently. For the purposes of determining area limitations, height limitations and type of construction, each portion of a building separated by one or more fire walls complying with Section 706 shall be considered to be a separate building.

Exceptions:

1.[HCD 1] Limited-density owner-built rural dwellings may be of any type of construction which will provide for a sound structural condition. Structural hazards which result in an unsound condition and which may constitute a substandard building are delineated by Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code.

2.Other than structural requirements, solar photovoltaic panels supported by a structure with no use underneath shall not constitute additional story or additional floor area and may exceed the height limit when constructed on a roof top of a building provided the following conditions are met:

2.1.For all occupancies, the highest point of the structure/panel shall meet the lower of the two values below:

1.3′ above the allowable building height per this code.

2.3′ above the roof of the building immediately below.

2.2.For installations on flat roofs in other than Group R-3 and R-4 occupancies, the highest point of the structure/panel shall meet the lower of the two values below:

1.10′ above the allowable building height per this code.

2.10′ above the roof of the building immediately below.

3.Other than structural requirements, solar photovoltaic panels supported by a structure over parking stalls shall not constitute additional story or additional floor area and may exceed the height limit as specified in exception 2 (above) when the following conditions are met (see Figure 5-1):

1.The area within the perimeter of the photovoltaic array has maximum rectangular dimension of 40 feet by 150 feet.

2.The distance between solar photovoltaic array structures is a minimum of 10 feet clear.

3.The driveway aisle separating solar photovoltaic array structures has a minimum width of 25 feet clear.

4.Solar photovoltaic array structure is used only for parking purposes with no storage.

5.Completely open on all sides (other than necessary structural supports) with no interior partitions.

503.1.1 Special industrial occupancies

Buildings and structures designed to house special industrial processes that require large areas and unusual building heights to accommodate craneways or special machinery and equipment, including, among others, rolling mills; structural metal fabrication shops and foundries; or the production and distribution of electric, gas or steam power, shall be exempt from the building height, number of stories and building area limitations specified in Sections 504 and 506.

503.1.2 Buildings on same lot

Two or more buildings on the same lot shall be regulated as separate buildings or shall be considered as portions of one building where the building height, number of stories of each building and the aggregate building area of the buildings are within the limitations specified in Sections 504 and 506. The provisions of this code applicable to the aggregate building shall be applicable to each building.

503.1.3 Type I construction

Buildings of Type I construction permitted to be of unlimited tabular building heights and areas are not subject to the special requirements that allow unlimited area buildings in Section 507 or unlimited building height in Sections 503.1.1 and 504.3 or increased building heights and areas for other types of construction.

503.1.4 Occupied roofs

A roof level or portion thereof shall be permitted to be used as an occupied roof provided the occupancy of the roof is an occupancy that is permitted by Table 504.4 for the story immediately below the roof. The area of the occupied roofs shall not be included in the building area as regulated by Section 506. An occupied roof shall not be included in the building height or number of stories as regulated by Section 504, provided that the penthouses and other enclosed rooftop structures comply with Section 1511.

Exceptions:

1.The occupancy located on an occupied roof shall not be limited to the occupancies allowed on the story immediately below the roof where the building is equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and occupant notification in accordance with Sections 907.5.2.1 and 907.5.2.3 is provided in the area of the occupied roof. Emergency voice/alarm communication system notification per Section 907.5.2.2 shall also be provided in the area of the occupied roof where such system is required elsewhere in the building.

2.Assembly occupancies shall be permitted on roofs of open parking spaces of Type I or Type II construction, in accordance with the exception to Section 903.2.1.6.

504.1.1 Unlimited area buildings

The height of unlimited area buildings shall be designed in accordance with Section 507.

504.1.2 Special provisions

The special provisions of Section 510 permit the use of special conditions that are exempt from, or modify, the specific requirements of this chapter regarding the allowable heights of buildings based on the occupancy classification and type of construction, provided the special condition complies with the provisions specified in Section 510.

504.2 Mixed occupancy

In a building containing mixed occupancies in accordance with Section 508, no individual occupancy shall exceed the height and number of story limits specified in this section for the applicable occupancies.

504.3 Height in feet

The maximum height, in feet, of a building shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 504.3.

Exception: Towers, spires, steeples and other rooftop structures shall be constructed of materials consistent with the required type of construction of the building except where other construction is permitted by Section 1511.2.4. Such structures shall not be used for habitation or storage. The structures shall be unlimited in height where of noncombustible materials and shall not extend more than 20 feet (6096 mm) above the allowable building height where of combustible materials (see Chapter 15 for additional requirements).
