CHAPTER 9 FIRE PROTECTION AND LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipment systems to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the California Fire Code.

SECTION 901 GENERAL

901.1 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter shall specify where fire protection and life safety systems are required and shall apply to the design, installation and operation of fire protection and life safety systems.

901.2 Fire protection systems.

Fire protection and life safety systems shall be installed, repaired, operated and maintained in accordance with this code and the California Fire Code.

Any fire protection or life safety system for which an exception or reduction to the provisions of this code has been granted shall be considered to be a required system.

Exception: Any fire protection or life safety system or portion thereof not required by this code shall be permitted to be installed for partial or complete protection provided that such system meets the requirements of this code.

901.3 Modifications.

Persons shall not remove or modify any fire protection system installed or maintained under the provisions of this code or the California Fire Code without approval by the building official.

901.4 Threads.

Threads provided for fire department connections to sprinkler systems, standpipes, yard hydrants or any other fire hose connection shall be compatible with the connections used by the local fire department.

901.5 Administration of installation acceptance tests. Administration of installation acceptance tests.

Fire protection systems shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of this code and the California Fire Code. Where required, the tests shall be conducted in the presence of the building official. Tests required by this code, the California Fire Code and the standards listed in this code shall be conducted at the expense of the owner or the owner’s authorized agent. It shall be unlawful to occupy portions of a structure until the required fire protection systems within that portion of the structure have been tested and approved.

901.6 Supervisory service.

Where required, fire protection systems shall be monitored by an approved supervising station in accordance with NFPA 72.

901.6.1 Automatic sprinkler systems.

Automatic sprinkler systems shall be monitored by an approved supervising station.

Exceptions:

1.A supervising station is not required for automatic sprinkler systems protecting one- and two-family dwellings.

2.Limited area systems in accordance with Section 903.3.8.

[F] [F] 901.6.2 Integrated testing.

Where two or more fire protection or life safety systems are interconnected, the intended response of subordinate fire protection and life safety systems shall be verified when required testing of the initiating system is conducted. In addition, integrated testing shall be performed in accordance with Sections 901.6.2.1 and 901.6.2.2.

[F] [F] 901.6.2.1 High-rise buildings.

For high-rise buildings, integrated testing shall comply with NFPA 4, with an integrated test performed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy and at intervals not exceeding 10 years, unless otherwise specified by an integrated system test plan prepared in accordance with NFPA 4. If an equipment failure is detected during integrated testing, a repeat of the integrated test shall not be required, except as necessary to verify operation of fire protection or life safety functions that are initiated by equipment that was repaired or replaced.

[F] [F] 901.6.2.2 Smoke control systems.

Where a fire alarm system is integrated with a smoke control system as outlined in Section 909, integrated testing shall comply with NFPA 4, with an integrated test performed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy and at intervals not exceeding 10 years, unless otherwise specified by an integrated system test plan prepared in accordance with NFPA 4. If an equipment failure is detected during integrated testing, a repeat of the integrated test shall not be required, except as necessary to verify operation of fire protection or life safety functions that are initiated by equipment that was repaired or replaced.

901.6.3 Fire alarm systems.

Fire alarm systems required by the provisions of Section 907.2 of this code and Sections 907.2 and 907.9 of the California Fire Code shall be monitored by an approved supervising station in accordance with Section 907.6.6 of this code.

Exceptions:

1.Single- and multiple-station smoke alarms required by Section 907.2.11.
