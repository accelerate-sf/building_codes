The IBC is a model code that provides minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare of the occupants of new and existing buildings and structures. The IBC is fully compatible with the ICC family of codes, including: the IECC, IEBC, IFC, IFGC, IgCC, IMC, IPC, IPSDC, IPMC, IRC, ISPSC, IWUIC, IZC and ICCPC.

The IBC addresses structural strength, means of egress, sanitation, adequate lighting and ventilation, accessibility, energy conservation and life safety in regard to new and existing buildings, facilities and systems. The codes are promulgated on a 3-year cycle to allow for new construction methods and technologies to be incorporated into the codes. Alternative materials, designs and methods not specifically addressed in the code can be approved by the building official where the proposed materials, designs or methods comply with the intent of the provisions of the code (see Section 104.11).

The IBC applies to all occupancies, including one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses that are not within the scope of the IRC. The IRC is referenced for coverage of detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses as defined in the exception to Section 101.2 and the definition for “Townhouse” in Chapter 2. The IRC can also be used for the construction of live/work units (as defined in Section 508.5) and small bed and breakfast-style hotels where there are five or fewer guest rooms and the hotel is owner occupied. The IBC applies to all types of buildings and structures unless exempted. Work exempted from permits is listed in Section 105.2.
