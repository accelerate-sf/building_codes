5. Additional testing requirements:

a.At the beginning of all masonry work, at least one test sample of the mortar shall be taken on three successive working days and at least at one-week intervals thereafter. Where mortar is based on a proportion specification, mortar shall be sampled and tested during construction in accordance with ASTM C780, including Annex 4, to verify the proportions specified in ASTM C270, Table 2. Where mortar is based on a property specification, mortar shall be laboratory prepared and tested prior to construction in accordance with ASTM C780 to verify the properties specified in ASTM C270, Table 1 and field sampled and tested during construction in accordance with ASTM C780 to verify the proportions with the laboratory tests. Mortar sampling and testing is not required for preblended mortars in conformance with ASTM C270 with a valid evaluation report.

b.Samples of grout shall be taken for each mix design, each day grout is placed, and not less than every 5,000 square feet of masonry wall area. The grout shall meet the minimum strength requirement given in ASTM C476/TMS 602 Section 2.2, or greater as specified.

c.Additional samples shall be taken whenever any change in materials or job conditions occur, as determined by the building official.

d.Test specimens for mortar and grout shall be made as set forth in ASTM C780/C1586 and ASTM C1019. When the prism test method is used in accordance with TMS 602, Article 1.4 B.3 during construction, the tests in this section are not required.

Exception: For nonbearing nonshear masonry walls not exceeding total wall height of 12 feet above the top of the foundation, mortar test shall be permitted to be limited to those at the beginning of masonry work for each mix design.

2115.8.2 Masonry core testing.

Not less than two cores shall be taken from each building for each 5,000 square feet (465 m2) of the masonry wall area or fraction thereof. The approved agency shall perform or observe the coring of the masonry walls and sample locations shall be subject to approval of the registered design professional.

Core samples shall comply with the following:

1.Cored no sooner than 7 days after grouting of the selected area;

2.Be a minimum of 33/4 inches (96 mm) in nominal diameter; and

3.Sampled in such a manner as to exclude any masonry unit webs, mortar joint, or reinforcing steel. If all cells contain reinforcement, alternate core locations or means to detect void or delamination shall be selected by the registered design professional and approved by the building official.

Visual examination of all cores shall be made by an approved agency and the condition of the cores reported as required by the California Administrative Code. Shear test shall test both joints between the grout core and the outside wythes or face shell of the masonry 28 days after grouting of the sample area using a shear test apparatus acceptable to the enforcement agency. Core samples shall not be soaked before testing. Core samples to be tested shall be stored in sealed plastic bags or non-absorbent containers immediately after coring and for at least 5 days prior to testing. The average unit shear value for each pair of cores (4 shear tests) from each 5,000 square feet of wall area (or less) on the cross section of the cores shall not be less than 2.5 √f ′m psi.

All cores shall be submitted to an approved agency for examination, even where the core specimens failed during the cutting operation. The approved agency shall report the location where each core was taken, the findings of their visual examination of each core, identify which cores were selected for shear testing, and the results of the shear tests.

Exceptions:

1.Core sampling and testing is not required for nonbearing nonshear masonry walls, not exceeding a total wall height of 12 feet above top of foundation, built with single-wythe hollow unit concrete masonry that attaches opposite face shells using webs cast as single unit, when designed using an f ′m not exceeding 2,000 psi (13.79 MPa).

2.An infrared thermographic survey or other nondestructive test procedures, shall be permitted to be approved as an alternative system to detect voids or delamination in grouted masonry in-lieu of core sampling and testing.

Replace TMS 402, Section 7.4.4.1 as follows and delete Section 7.4.5.1:

7.4.4.1 Minimum reinforcement requirements for masonry walls. The total area of reinforcement in reinforced masonry walls shall not be less than 0.003 times the sectional area of the wall. Neither the horizontal nor the vertical reinforcement shall be less than one third of the total. Horizontal and vertical reinforcement shall be spaced at not more than 24 inches (610 mm) center to center.

Exception: Reinforced hollow-unit masonry used for freestanding site walls or interior nonbearing nonshear wall partitions shall have horizontal reinforcing spaced not more than 4’-0” on center, except for locations in Seismic Design Category F, and may be grouted only in cells containing vertical and horizontal reinforcement..

Vertical wall reinforcement shall have dowels of equal size and equally matched spacing in all footings. Reinforcement shall be continuous around wall corners and through intersections. Only reinforcement which is continuous in the wall shall be considered in computing the minimum area of reinforcement. Reinforcement with splices conforming to TMS 402 shall be considered as continuous reinforcement.

7.4.4.1.2 Horizontal reinforcing bars in bond beams shall be provided in the top of footings, at the top of wall openings, at roof and floor levels, and at the top of parapet walls. For walls 12 inches (nominal) (305 mm) or more in thickness, horizontal and vertical reinforcement shall be equally divided into two layers, except where designed as retaining walls. Where reinforcement is added above the minimum requirements, such additional reinforcement need not be so divided.

7.4.4.1.3 In bearing walls of every type of reinforced masonry, there shall be trim reinforcement of not less than one No. 5 bar or two No. 4 bars on all sides of, and adjacent to, every opening which exceeds 16 inches (406 mm) in either direction, and such bars shall extend not less than 48 diameters, but in no case less than 24 inches (610 mm) beyond the corners of the opening. The bars required by this paragraph shall be in addition to the minimum reinforcement required elsewhere.

The thickness of masonry walls shall be designed so that allowable maximum stresses specified in this chapter are not exceeded. Masonry walls shall not exceed the height or length-to-thickness ratio nor be less than the minimum thickness as specified in this chapter and as set forth in Table 8.3.4.4.

Piers. Every pier or wall section which width is less than three times its thickness shall be designed and constructed as required for columns if such pier is a structural member. Every pier or wall section which width is between three and five times its thickness or less than one half the height of adjacent openings shall have all horizontal steel in the form of ties except that in walls 12 inches (305 mm) or less in thickness such steel may be in the form of hair-pins.
