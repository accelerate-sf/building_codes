CHAPTER 27 ELECTRICAL

User note:

About this chapter: Electrical systems and components are integral to most structures; therefore, it is necessary for the code to address their installation and protection. Structures depend on electricity for the operation of many life safety systems including fire alarm, smoke control and exhaust, fire suppression, fire command and communication systems. Since power supply to these systems is essential, Chapter 27 addresses where standby and emergency power must be provided.

SECTION 2701 GENERAL

The provisions of this chapter and the California Electrical Code shall govern the design, construction, erection and installation of the electrical components, appliances, equipment and systems used in buildings and structures covered by this code. The California Fire Code, the International Property Maintenance Code and the California Electrical Code shall govern the use and maintenance of electrical components, appliances, equipment and systems. The California Existing Building Code and the California Electrical Code shall govern the alteration, repair, relocation, replacement and addition of electrical components, appliances, or equipment and systems.
