Where there is a conflict between the requirements of this code and the requirements of Sections 402.8.1 through 402.8.8, the requirements of Sections 402.8.1 through 402.8.8 shall apply.

402.8.1 Mall width

For the purpose of providing required egress, malls are permitted to be considered as corridors but need not comply with the requirements of Section 1005.1 of this code where the width of the mall is as specified in this section.

402.8.1.1 Minimum width

The aggregate clear egress width of the mall in either a covered or open mall building shall be not less than 20 feet (6096 mm). The mall width shall be sufficient to accommodate the occupant load served. Any portion of the minimum required aggregate egress width shall be not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) measured to a height of 8 feet (2438 mm) between any projection of a tenant space bordering the mall and the nearest kiosk, vending machine, bench, display opening, food court or other obstruction to means of egress travel.

402.8.2 Determination of occupant load

The occupant load permitted in any individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building shall be determined as required by this code. Means of egress requirements for individual tenant spaces shall be based on the occupant load thus determined.

402.8.2.1 Occupant formula

In determining required means of egress of the mall, the number of occupants for whom means of egress are to be provided shall be based on gross leasable area of the covered or open mall building (excluding anchor buildings) and the occupant load factor as determined by Equation 4-1.

where:

OLF = The occupant load factor (square feet per person).

GLA = The gross leasable area (square feet).

Exception: Tenant spaces attached to a covered or open mall building but with a means of egress system that is totally independent of the open mall of an open mall building or of a covered mall building shall not be considered as gross leasable area for determining the required means of egress for the mall building.

402.8.2.2 OLF range

The occupant load factor (OLF) is not required to be less than 30 and shall not exceed 50.

402.8.2.3 Anchor buildings

The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in computing the total number of occupants for the mall.

402.8.2.4 Food courts

The occupant load of a food court shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004. For the purposes of determining the means of egress requirements for the mall, the food court occupant load shall be added to the occupant load of the covered or open mall building as calculated in Section 402.8.2.1.

402.8.3 Number of means of egress

Wherever the distance of travel to the mall from any location within a tenant space used by persons other than employees is greater than 75 feet (22 860 mm) or the tenant space has an occupant load of 50 or more, not fewer than two means of egress shall be provided.

402.8.4 Arrangements of means of egress

Assembly occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or more located within a covered mall building shall be so located such that their entrance will be immediately adjacent to a principal entrance to the mall and shall have not less than one-half of their required means of egress opening directly to the exterior of the covered mall building. Assembly occupancies located within the perimeter line of an open mall building shall be permitted to have their main exit open to the open mall.

402.8.4.1 Anchor building means of egress

Required means of egress for anchor buildings shall be provided independently from the mall means of egress system. The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in determining means of egress requirements for the mall. The path of egress travel of malls shall not exit through anchor buildings. Malls terminating at an anchor building where other means of egress has not been provided shall be considered as a dead-end mall.

402.8.5 Distance to exits

Within each individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building, the distance of travel from any point to an exit or entrance to the mall shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).

The distance of travel from any point within a mall of a covered mall building to an exit shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm). The maximum distance of travel from any point within an open mall to the perimeter line of the open mall building shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).

402.8.6 Access to exits

Where more than one exit is required, they shall be so arranged that it is possible to travel in either direction from any point in a mall of a covered mall building to separate exits or from any point in an open mall of an open mall building to two separate locations on the perimeter line, provided that neither location is an exterior wall of an anchor building or parking garage. The width of an exit passageway or corridor from a mall shall be not less than 66 inches (1676 mm).

Exception: Access to exits is permitted by way of a dead-end mall that does not exceed a length equal to twice the width of the mall measured at the narrowest location within the dead-end portion of the mall.

402.8.6.1 Exit passageways

Where exit passageways provide a secondary means of egress from a tenant space, the exit passageways shall be constructed in accordance with Section 1024.

402.8.7 Service areas fronting on exit passageways

Mechanical rooms, electrical rooms, building service areas and service elevators are permitted to open directly into exit passageways, provided that the exit passageway is separated from such rooms with not less than 1-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711, or both. The fire protection rating of openings in the fire barriers shall be not less than 1 hour.

402.8.8 Security grilles and doors

Horizontal sliding or vertical security grilles or doors that are a part of a required means of egress shall conform to the following:

1.Doors and grilles shall remain in the full open position during the period of occupancy by the general public.

2.Doors or grilles shall not be brought to the closed position when there are 10 or more persons occupying spaces served by a single exit or 50 or more persons occupying spaces served by more than one exit.

3.The doors or grilles shall be openable from within without the use of any special knowledge or effort where the space is occupied.

4.Where two or more exits are required, not more than one-half of the exits shall be permitted to include either a horizontal sliding or vertical rolling grille or door.

SECTION 403 HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS AND GROUP I-2 OCCUPANCIES HAVING OCCUPIED FLOORS LOCATED MORE THAN 75 FEET ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF FIRE DEPARTMENT VEHICLE ACCESS HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS AND GROUP I-2 OCCUPANCIES HAVING OCCUPIED FLOORS LOCATED MORE THAN 75 FEET ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF FIRE DEPARTMENT VEHICLE ACCESS

403.1 Applicability

New high-rise buildings (see Section 202 for definition of a high-rise) and new Group I-2 occupancies having occupied floors located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access shall comply with Sections 403.2 through 403.7.

Exceptions: The provisions of Sections 403.2 through 403.7 shall not apply to the following buildings and structures:

1.Airport traffic control towers in accordance with Section 412.2.

2.Open parking garages in accordance with Section 406.5.

3.The portion of a building containing a Group A-5 occupancy in accordance with Section 303.6.

4.Special industrial occupancies in accordance with Section 503.1.1.

5.Buildings such as power plants, lookout towers, steeples, grain houses and similar structures with noncontinuous human occupancy, when so determined by the enforcing agency.

For existing high-rise buildings and for existing Group R occupancies, see California Fire Code Chapter 11 and California Existing Building Code.

For the purpose of this section, in determining the level from which the highest occupied floor is to be measured, the enforcing agency should exercise reasonable judgment, including consideration of overall accessibility to the building by fire department personnel and vehicular equipment. When a building is located on sloping terrain and there is building access on more than one level, the enforcing agency may select the level that provides the most logical and adequate fire department access.

403.2 Construction
