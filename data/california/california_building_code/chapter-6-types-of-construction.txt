CHAPTER 6 TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 6 establishes five types of construction in which each building must be categorized. This chapter looks at the materials used in the building (combustible or noncombustible) and the extent to which building elements such as the building frame, roof, wall and floor can resist fire. Depending on the type of construction and the specific building element, fire resistance of 1 to 3 hours is specified.
