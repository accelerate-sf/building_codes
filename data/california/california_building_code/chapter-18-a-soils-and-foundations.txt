SECTION 1812A EARTH RETAINING SHORING

1812A.1 General.

The requirements of this section shall apply to temporary and permanent earth retaining shoring using soldier piles and lagging with or without tie-back anchors in soil or rock, only when existing or new facilities are affected. Shoring used as construction means and methods only, which does not affect existing or new facilities, are not regulated by this section and shall satisfy the requirements of the authorities having jurisdiction.

Design, construction, testing and inspection shall satisfy the requirements of this code except as modified in Sections 1812A.2 through 1812A.8.

1812A.2 Duration.

Shoring shall be considered temporary when elements of the shoring will be exposed to site conditions for a period of less than or equal to 2 years, and shall be considered permanent otherwise. Permanent shoring shall account for the increase in lateral soil pressure due to earthquake. At the end of the construction period, the existing and new structures shall not rely on the temporary shoring for support in any way. Wood components shall not be used for permanent shoring lasting more than 2 years. Wood components of the temporary shoring that may affect the performance of permanent structure shall be removed after the shoring is no longer required.

All components of the shoring shall have corrosion protection or preservative treatment for their expected duration. Wood components of the temporary shoring that will not be removed shall be treated in accordance with AWPA U1 (Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B and Section 5.2), and shall be identified in accordance with Section 2303.1.9.1.

1812A.3 Surcharge.

Surcharge pressure due to footings, traffic or other sources shall be considered in design. If the footing surcharge is located within the semicircular distribution or bulb of earth pressure (when shoring is located close to a footings), lagging shall be designed for lateral earth pressure due to footing surcharge. Soil arching effects may be considered in the design of lagging. Underpinning of the footing may be used in lieu of designing the shoring and lagging for surcharge pressure. Alternatively, continuously contacting drilled pier shafts near the footings shall be permitted. The lateral surcharge design pressure shall be derived using Boussinesq equations modified for the distribution of stresses in an elastic medium due to a uniform, concentrated or line surface load as appropriate and soil arching effects.

1812A.4 Design and testing:

Except for the modifications as set forth in Sections 1812A.4.1 through 1812A.4.3, all Prestressed Rock and Soil Tie-back Anchors shall comply with PTI Recommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors.

7.The periodic basis of shoring monitoring, as a minimum, shall be as follows:

a.Initial monitoring shall be performed prior to any excavation.

b.Once excavation has begun, the periodic readings shall be taken weekly until excavation reaches the estimated subgrade elevation and the permanent foundation is complete.

c.If performance of the shoring is within established guidelines, shoring design engineer may permit the periodic readings to be bi-weekly. Once initiated, bi-weekly readings shall continue until the building slab at ground floor level is completed and capable of transmitting lateral loads to the permanent structure. Thereafter, readings can be monthly.
