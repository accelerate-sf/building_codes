Braces in K- or V- configurations and braces supporting gravity loads other than self-weight are not permitted under this exception.

2212.2.2 2212.2.2 Section D2. Section D2.

Modify Section D2.6c(b)(2) as follows:

(2) the moment calculated using the load combinations of the applicable building code, including the amplified seismic load, provided the connection or other mechanism within the column base is designed to have the ductility necessary to accommodate the column base rotation resulting from the design story drift.

In addition to the requirements of Section 2206.2, steel and concrete composite special moment frame with the approved moment connections in accordance with AISC 358 Chapter 10 shall be permitted provided:

1.Beams are provided with reduced beam sections (RBS);

2.Web extension to beam web two-sided fillet welds are sized to develop expected strength of the beam web and shall not be less than a 1/4-inch fillet weld; and
