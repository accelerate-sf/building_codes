CHAPTER 15 ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 15 provides minimum requirements for the design and construction of roof assemblies and rooftop structures. The criteria address the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is largely prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also recognizes newer products. Section 1511 addresses rooftop structures, which include penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under Chapter 5.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF], [BG] or [P] will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
