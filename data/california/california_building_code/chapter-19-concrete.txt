CHAPTER 19 CONCRETE

Italics are used for text within Sections 1903 through 1905 of this code to indicate model code provisions that differ from ACI 318. State of California amendments in these sections are shown in italics and underlined.

User notes:

About this chapter: Chapter 19 provides minimum accepted practices for the design and construction of buildings and structural components using concrete—both plain and reinforced. Chapter 19 relies primarily on the reference to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete. Structural concrete must be designed and constructed to comply with this code and all listed standards. There are also specific provisions addressing concrete slabs and shotcrete.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
