																							APPENDIX D FIRE DISTRICTS

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix D establishes a framework by which a jurisdiction can establish a portion of a jurisdiction as a fire district. Fire districts are often designated in a more densely developed portion of a city where limiting the potential spread of fire is a key consideration. Specific construction types and users are prohibited in a fire district.

SECTION D101 GENERAL

D101.1 Scope.

The fire district shall include such territory or portion as outlined in an ordinance or law entitled “An Ordinance (Resolution) Creating and Establishing a Fire District.” Wherever, in such ordinance creating and establishing a fire district, reference is made to the fire district, it shall be construed to mean the fire district designated and referred to in this appendix.

D101.1.1 Mapping.

The fire district complying with the provisions of Section D101.1 shall be shown on a map that shall be available to the public.

D101.2 Establishment of area.

For the purpose of this code, the fire district shall include that territory or area as described in Sections D101.2.1 through D101.2.3.

D101.2.1 Adjoining blocks.

Two or more adjoining blocks, exclusive of intervening streets, where not less than 50 percent of the ground area is built upon and more than 50 percent of the built-on area is devoted to hotels and motels of Group R-1; Group B occupancies; theaters, nightclubs, restaurants of Group A-1 and A-2 occupancies; garages, express and freight depots, warehouses and storage buildings used for the storage of finished products (not located with and forming a part of a manufactured or industrial plant); or Group S occupancy. Where the average height of a building is two and one-half stories or more, a block should be considered if the ground area built upon is not less than 40 percent.

D101.2.2 Buffer zone.

Where four contiguous blocks or more comprise a fire district, there shall be a buffer zone of 200 feet (60 960 mm) around the perimeter of such district. Streets, rights-of-way and other open spaces not subject to building construction can be included in the 200- foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone.

D101.2.3 Developed blocks.

Where blocks adjacent to the fire district have developed to the extent that not less than 25 percent of the ground area is built upon and 40 percent or more of the built-on area is devoted to the occupancies specified in Section D101.2.1, they can be considered for inclusion in the fire district, and can form all or a portion of the 200-foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone required in Section D101.2.2.

SECTION D102 BUILDING RESTRICTIONS

D102.1 Types of construction permitted.

Within the fire district every building hereafter erected shall be Type I, II, III or IV, except as permitted in Section D104.

D102.2 Other specific requirements.

D102.2.1 Exterior walls.

Exterior walls of buildings located in the fire district shall comply with the requirements in Table 601 except as required in Section D102.2.6.

D102.2.2 Group H prohibited.

Group H occupancies shall be prohibited from location within the fire district.

D102.2.3 Construction type.

Every building shall be constructed as required based on the type of construction indicated in Chapter 6.

D102.2.4 Roof covering.

Roof covering in the fire district shall conform to the requirements of Class A or B roof coverings as defined in Section 1505.

D102.2.5 Structural fire rating.

Walls, floors, roofs and their supporting structural members shall be not less than 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.

Exceptions:

1.Buildings of Type IV-HT construction.

2.Buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1.

3.Automobile parking structures.

4.Buildings surrounded on all sides by a permanently open space of not less than 30 feet (9144 mm).

5.Partitions complying with Section 603.1, Item 11.

D102.2.6 Exterior walls.

Exterior load-bearing walls of Type II buildings shall have a fire-resistance rating of 2 hours or more where such walls are located within 30 feet (9144 mm) of a common property line or an assumed property line. Exterior nonload-bearing walls of Type II buildings located within 30 feet (9144 mm) of a common property line or an assumed property line shall have fireresistance ratings as required by Table 601, but not less than 1 hour. Exterior walls located more than 30 feet (9144 mm) from a common property line or an assumed property line shall comply with Table 601.

Exception: In the case of one-story buildings that are 2,000 square feet (186 m2) or less in area, exterior walls located more than 15 feet (4572 mm) from a common property line or an assumed property line need only comply with Table 601.

D102.2.7 Architectural trim.

Architectural trim on buildings located in the fire district shall be constructed of approved noncombustible materials or fire-retardanttreated wood.

D102.2.8 Permanent canopies.

Permanent canopies are permitted to extend over adjacent open spaces provided that all of the following are met:

1.The canopy and its supports shall be of noncombustible material, fire-retardant-treated wood, Type IV construction or of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.

Exception: Any textile covering for the canopy shall be flame resistant as determined by tests conducted in accordance with NFPA 701 after both accelerated water leaching and accelerated weathering.

2.Any canopy covering, other than textiles, shall have a flame spread index not greater than 25 when tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723 in the form intended for use.

3.The canopy shall have one long side open.

4.The maximum horizontal width of the canopy shall be not greater than 15 feet (4572 mm).

5.The fire resistance of exterior walls shall not be reduced.

D102.2.9 Roof structures.

Structures, except aerial supports 12 feet (3658 mm) high or less, flagpoles, water tanks and cooling towers, placed above the roof of any building within the fire district shall be of noncombustible material and shall be supported by construction of noncombustible material.

D102.2.10 Plastic signs.

The use of plastics complying with Section 2611 for signs is permitted provided that the structure of the sign in which the plastic is mounted or installed is noncombustible.

Exterior plastic veneer is not permitted in the fire district.

SECTION D103 CHANGES TO BUILDINGS

Nor shall any existing building be extended on any side, nor square footage or floors added within the existing building unless such modifications are of a type of construction permitted for new buildings within the fire district.

D103.2 Other alterations.

Nothing in Section D103.1 shall prohibit other alterations within the fire district provided that such alterations do not create a change of occupancy that is otherwise prohibited or increase the fire hazard.
