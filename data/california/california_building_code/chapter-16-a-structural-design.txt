g.For steel structural members, the deflection due to creep component of long-term dead load shall be permitted to be taken as zero.

h.For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/175 for each glass lite or l/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall not exceed 1/120.

The deflection limits of Section 1604A.3.1 shall be used unless more restrictive deflection limits are required by a referenced standard for the element or finish material.

1604A.3.7 1604A.3.7 Framing supporting glass.

The deflection of framing members supporting glass subjected to 0.6 times the “component and cladding” wind loads shall not exceed either of the following:

1.1/175 of the length of span of the framing member, for framing members having a length not more than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).

2.1/240 of the length of span of the framing member + 1/4 inch (6.4 mm), for framing members having a length greater than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).

1604A.3.8 Horizontal diaphragms.

The maximum span-depth ratio for any roof or floor diaphragm consisting of steel and composite steel slab decking shall not exceed those given in Table 1604A.4, unless test data and design calculations acceptable to the enforcement agency are submitted and approved for the use of other span-depth ratios. Concrete diaphragms shall not exceed the span depth ratios for the equivalent composite steel-slab diaphragm in Table 1604A.4.

1604A.3.9 Deflections.

Deflection criteria for materials not specified shall be developed by the project architect or structural engineer in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section and approved by the enforcement agency.

1604A.4 1604A.4 Analysis.

Load effects on structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of structural analysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geometric compatibility and both short- and long-term material properties.

Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their analysis the effects of added deformations expected to occur during their service life.

Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.

The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided that their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. Structural analysis shall explicitly include consideration of stiffness of diaphragms in accordance with ASCE 7, Section 12.3.1. A diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal to two times the average story drift. Where required by ASCE 7, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system.

Every structure shall be designed to resist the effects caused by the forces specified in this chapter, including overturning, uplift and sliding. Where sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction between sliding elements shall be included as a force.

[OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 4, & 5]

1.General. Independent peer review is an objective technical review by knowledgeable reviewer(s) experienced in structural design, analysis and performance issues involved. The reviewer(s) shall examine the available information on the condition of the building, basic engineering concept employed and recommendations for action.

2.Timing of Independent Review. The independent reviewer (s) shall be selected prior to initiation of substantial portion of the design and analysis work that is to be reviewed, and review shall start as soon as practical and sufficient information defining the project is available.

3.Qualifications and Terms of Employment. The reviewer shall be independent from the design and construction team.

3.1.The reviewer(s) shall have no other involvement in the project before, during or after the review, except in a review capacity.

3.2.The reviewer shall be selected and paid by owner and shall have technical expertise similar to the project being reviewed, as determined by enforcement agent.

3.3.The reviewer (in case of review team, the chair) shall be a California-licensed structural engineer who is familiar with technical issues and regulations governing the work to be reviewed.

3.4.The reviewer shall serve through completion of the project and shall not be terminated except for failure to perform the duties specified herein. Such termination shall be in writing with copies to enforcement agent, owner and the engineer of record. When a reviewer is terminated or resigns, a qualified replacement shall be appointed within 10 working days or a timeframe mutually agreed to by the Owner, Registered Design Professional (RDP) and the Office.

4.Scope of Review. Review activities shall include, where appropriate, available construction documents, design criteria, observation of the condition of structure, all new and original inspection reports, including methods of sampling, analyses prepared by the engineer of record and consultants, and the new, retrofit or repair design. Review shall include consideration of the proposed design approach, method, materials and details.

5.Reports. The reviewer(s) shall prepare a written report to the owner and responsible enforcement agent that covers all aspect of the review performed including conclusions reached by the reviewer. Report shall be issued after the schematic phase, during design development, and at the completion of construction documents, but prior to their issuance of permit. Such report shall include, at the minimum, statement of the following:

a.Scope of engineering design peer review with limitations defined.

b.The status of the project documents at each review stage.

c.Ability of selected materials and framing systems to meet the performance criteria with given loads and configuration.

d.Degree of structural system redundancy and the deformation compatibility among structural and nonstructural elements.

e.Basic constructability of the new, retrofit or repair system.

f.Other recommendation that will be appropriate for the specific project.

g.Presentation of the conclusions of the reviewer identifying any areas that need further review, investigation and/or clarification.

h.Recommendations.
