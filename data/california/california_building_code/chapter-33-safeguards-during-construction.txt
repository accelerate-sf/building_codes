CHAPTER 33 SAFEGUARDS DURING CONSTRUCTION

User notes:

About this chapter: While the balance of the chapters in this code specify how a building is to be designed and constructed in order to be in compliance with the code, Chapter 33 looks to the actual construction process. Parameters are provided for demolition and for protecting adjacent property during demolition and construction. This chapter also addresses the need for a fire watch during nonworking hours for certain buildings once the construction has progressed significantly. Issues such as how to provide egress while the building is growing, the timing of standpipe and sprinkler installation, and protection of pedestrians are addressed.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BS] will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
