Multiple options exist for membranes, mortars, grouts, and other materials and must be clearly specified to be included. If not specifically indicated, optional materials are not included and mortar/grout choice defaults to minimum performance specification indicated. Consider each system component and intended use to determine minimum requirements and to specify options.

Ceramic tile—ANSI A137.1.

Glass tile, when used—ANSI A137.2; see also "Glass Tile Selection and Installation Guide," and consult tile manufacturer for environmental exposure classification recommendations. Not all glass tiles are suitable.

Cementitious grout—ANSI A118.6 or better or ISO CG1 or better. When glass tile is used, specify grout designated by tile and grout manufacturers.

Epoxy grout, when used—ANSI A118.3 or ISO RG.

Cementitious bond coat—portland cement paste on a mortar bed that is still workable. For a cured mortar bed, follow recommendations below to select appropriate bonding mortar:

• When a waterproof membrane is not used—ANSI A118.1 or better or ISO C1 or better.
• When a waterproof membrane is used—ANSI A118.4 or better or ISO C2S1 or better unless ANSI A118.1 or ISO C1 is recommended by membrane manufacturer.
• When porcelain tile is used—ANSI A118.4 or better or ISO C2 or better.
• When glass tile is used, specify mortar designated by tile and mortar manufacturers. Bond coat color will impact the final appearance of translucent glass tile. Specifier shall confirm bond coat color is acceptable.

• When a waterproof membrane is not used—ANSI A118.1 or better or ISO C1 or better.

• When a waterproof membrane is used—ANSI A118.4 or better or ISO C2S1 or better unless ANSI A118.1 or ISO C1 is recommended by membrane manufacturer.

• When porcelain tile is used—ANSI A118.4 or better or ISO C2 or better.

• When glass tile is used, specify mortar designated by tile and mortar manufacturers. Bond coat color will impact the final appearance of translucent glass tile. Specifier shall confirm bond coat color is acceptable.

Epoxy bond coat, when used—ANSI A118.3 or ISO R1 or better.

• When glass tile is used, specify epoxy bond coat designated by tile and bond coat manufacturers. Bond coat color will impact the final appearance of translucent glass tile. Specifier shall confirm bond coat color is acceptable.

• When glass tile is used, specify epoxy bond coat designated by tile and bond coat manufacturers. Bond coat color will impact the final appearance of translucent glass tile. Specifier shall confirm bond coat color is acceptable.

Vapor retarder membrane, when used—ANSI A108.02-3.8.

Waterproof membrane, when used—ANSI A118.10.

Mortar bed, metal lath, and cleavage membrane—ANSI A108.1A.

Flexible mildew-resistant sealant—ASTM C920.

Shower pan membrane—local building code.

Metal studs—ASTM C645.

Wall framing shall meet the general framing requirements of ANSI A108.11-4.0—4.3.

Apply blocking between the studs to support the shower pan membrane.
Movement joints—mandatory according to EJ171.

When glass tile is used, adhere to more frequent placement recommendations within the ranges listed in EJ171.
Shower pan membrane—ANSI A108.01-3.6.

Tile—ANSI A108.1A, .1B, or .1C. A108.1B required if waterproof membrane or epoxy bond coat to be used.
