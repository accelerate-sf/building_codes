727.0 [OSHPD 1] Emergency Sanitary Drainage
727.1
For new acute care hospital buildings submitted after
the effective date of this code, the hospital shall have an on-site
holding tank[s] to store sewage and liquid waste sufficient
to operate essential hospital utilities and equipment in the acute
care hospital building, to support 72 hours of continuing operation
in the event of an emergency. Any general acute care hospital
in operation after January 1, 2030 shall have an on-site
holding tank[s] to store sewage and liquid waste sufficient to
operate essential hospital utilities and equipment in the acute
care hospital buildings on the campus with an SPC-3, SPC-4,
or SPC-5 rating, to support 72 hours of continuing operation
in the event of an emergency. The emergency waste holding
capacity shall be based on the Water Conservation/Water
Rationing Plan required in Section 615.4.1. See also California
Building Code, Part 2, Section 1616A.1.42.

Exception: Hook-ups that allow for the use of transportable
means of sewage and liquid waste disposal may be provided
instead of on-site storage if the hospital has a plan for storage
of sewage and liquid waste. This plan may include the
use of leak-proof bags if adequate storage of these and other
bags of waste are provided. These storage facilities shall comply
with the appropriate local health and environmental
authorities' requirements, California Department of Public
Health requirements for medical waste management, and
comply with the following minimum requirements:

Location[s]. Location[s] shall be provided for waste collection
and storage with sufficient space based upon the
volume of projected waste and length of anticipated storage.

Enclosure[s]. Lockable room[s] or lockable screened
enclosure[s] of adequate capacity to store the quantity
of waste anticipated shall be provided for the washing
and cleaning of containers and for the storage of sewage
and waste water.




     The room[s] or screened enclosure[s] shall include
the following:

Floor and curb. A sealed concrete floor or other
approved impervious flooring with a curb and with
a drain connected to the sewer.

Water. Steam or hot water and cold water supplies in
accordance with the California Plumbing Code.
