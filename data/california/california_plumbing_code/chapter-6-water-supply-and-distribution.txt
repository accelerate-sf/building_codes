regulate the temperature of hot water delivered to
plumbing fixtures used by patients to a range of 105°F (41°C)
minimum to 120°F (49°C) maximum. High temperature
alarm set at 125°F (52°C) shall be provided. The
audible/visual device for the high temperature alarm shall
annunciate at a continuously occupied location.

613.6
Hot-water distribution system serving patient care
areas shall be under constant mechanical recirculation to provide
continuous hot water at each hot water outlet. Non-recirculated
fixture branch piping shall not exceed 25 feet (7.62
meters) in length. Dead-end piping (risers with no flow,
branches with no fixture) shall not be installed. In renovation
projects, dead-end piping shall be removed in the area of renovation.
Empty risers, mains, and branches installed for future
use shall be permitted.

613.7
At fixtures where water exceeding 125°F (52°C) is accessible
to patients or personnel, warning signs in letters at least
2 inches (51 mm) high shall be posted above the fixtures.

[OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 3, 4 & 5] Dialysis water feedlines
shall be PVC (polyvinyl chloride), glass, stainless steel, or
PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) and sized to provide a minimum
velocity of 1.5 feet per second (0.46 m/s). The piping shall
be a singleloop system with or without recirculation. Branches
to dialysis machines shall be 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) inside dimension
and take off from the bottom of the main feedline. Branch lines
may be PFA (perfluoroalkoxy).

614.2
All piping for multistation or central dialysis units shall
be rigid where possible. All piping and tubing shall be in a neat
arrangement. The placement of piping or tubing on the floor is
not permitted.

614.3
All valves shall be located in accessible locations.

614.4
Piping and valves shall be identified according to their
function.

614.5
A means of preventing backwashing or flushing of the
system when one or more stations are in operation shall be provided.

614.6
A continuous audible alarm shall sound at the nurses'
station and remote equipment rooms when the minimum velocity
is not maintained, or if backwashing or flushing is attempted
while one or more stations are in operation.

614.7
Water used for dialysis treatment shall meet the latest
edition of ANSI/American Association of Medical Instrumentations
(AAMI) RD62, Water treatment equipment for hemodialysis
applications.

614.8
A diagram of all piping as installed shall be posted at the
nurses' station and equipment room of all multistation or central

have an on-site water supply sufficient to operate essential
hospital utilities and equipment in the acute care
hospital building, to support 72 hours of continuing
operation in the event of an emergency. Any general
acute care hospital in operation after January 1, 2030
shall have an on-site water supply sufficient to operate
essential hospital utilities and equipment in the acute
care hospital buildings on the campus with an SPC-3,
SPC-4, or SPC-5 rating, to support 72 hours of continuing
operation in the event of an emergency. See also
California Building Code, Part 2, Section 1616A.1.42.





     The emergency water storage capacity shall be computed
based on an approved Water Conservation/Water
Rationing Plan to provide for 72 hours of operation,
accepted by the licensing agency. For acute care hospital
facilities or buildings required to meet NPC-5, on-site
water supply of not less than 150 gallons [567. 9 L]
[based on 50 gallons/day/bed for 72 hours] of potable
water per licensed bed shall be provided. In no event
shall the campus on-site water storage capacity be less
than one tank with at least 5,000 gallons capacity.






     The emergency supply shall have fittings to allow
for replenishment of the water supply from transportable
water sources and a means to dispense water to portable
containers in the event that normal water supply
becomes unavailable.

Exception: With the approval of the Office and the
licensing agency, hook-ups that allow for the use of transportable
sources of potable water may be provided in lieu
of 72 hours of on-site storage if a minimum onsite water
supply of potable and industrial water is provided, sufficient
to support 24 hours of operation, without replenishment
based on the hospital's approved Water
Conservation/Water Rationing plan. In no event shall the
on-site water storage capacity be less than one tank with
at least 5,000 gallons capacity. This emergency supply
tank shall have fittings to allow for replenishment of the
water supply from transportable water sources and a
means to dispense water to portable containers in the
event that normal water supply becomes unavailable.
