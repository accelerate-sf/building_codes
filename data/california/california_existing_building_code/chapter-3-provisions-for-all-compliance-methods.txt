317.2 Scope.

All alterations, additions and/or repairs to existing structures or portions thereof shall, at a minimum, be designed and constructed to resist the effects of seismic ground motions as provided in this section. The structural system shall be evaluated by a registered design professional and, if not meeting or exceeding the minimum seismic design performance requirements of this section, shall be retrofitted in compliance with these requirements.

Exception:  Those structures for which Section 317.3 determines that assessment is not required, or for which Section 317.4 determines that retrofit is not needed, then only the requirements of Section 317.11 apply.

317.3 Applicability.

317.3.1 Existing state-owned buildings.

[BSC] For existing state-owned structures including all buildings owned by the University of California and the California State University, the requirements of Section 317 apply whenever the structure is to be retrofitted, repaired or modified and any of the following apply:

1.Total construction cost, not including cost of furnishings, fixtures and equipment, or normal maintenance, for the building exceeds 25 percent of the construction cost for the replacement of the existing building. The changes are cumulative for past modifications to the building that occurred after adoption of the 1995 California Building Code and did not require seismic retrofit.

2.There are changes in risk category.

3.The modification to the structural components increases the seismic forces in or strength requirements of any structural component of the existing structure by more than 10 percent cumulative since the original construction, unless the component has the capacity to resist the increased forces determined in accordance with Section 319. If the building’s seismic base shear capacity has been increased since the original construction, the percent change in base shear may be calculated relative to the increased value.

4.Structural elements need repair where the damage has reduced the lateral-load-resisting capacity of the structural system by more than 10 percent.

5.Changes in live or dead load increase story shear by more than 10 percent.

317.3.2 Public school buildings.

[DSA-SS] For public schools, the provisions of Section 317 apply when required in accordance with Sections 4-307 and 4-309(c) of the California Administrative Code.

317.3.3 Community college buildings.

[DSA-SS/CC] For community colleges, the provisions of Section 317 apply when required in accordance with Sections 4-307 and 4-309(c) of the California Administrative Code.

317.4 Evaluation required.

If the criteria in Section 317.3 apply to the project under consideration, the design professional of record shall provide an evaluation in accordance with Section 317 to determine the seismic performance of the building in its current configuration and condition. If the structure's seismic performance as required by Section 317.5 is evaluated as satisfactory and the peer reviewer(s), when Method B of Section 321 is used, concur, then no structural retrofit is required.

317.5 Minimum seismic design performance levels for structural and nonstructural components.

Following the notations of ASCE 41, the seismic requirements for design and assessment are based upon a prescribed Seismic Hazard Level (BSE-1N, BSE-2N, BSE-1E, BSE-R or BSE-C), a specified structural performance level (S-1 through S-5) and a nonstructural performance level (N-A through N-E). The minimum seismic performance criteria are given in Table 317.5 according to the Building Regulatory Authority and the Risk Category as determined in Chapter 16 of the California Building Code or by the regulatory authority. The building shall be evaluated in accordance with a Tier 3 Systematic Evaluation and Retrofit per ASCE 41 Chapter 6 for both the Level 1 and Level 2 performance levels, and the more restrictive requirements shall apply.

Exception:  If the floor area of an addition is greater than the larger of 50 percent of the floor area of the original building or 1,000 square feet (93 m2), then the Table 317.5 entries for BSE-R (or BSE-1E) and BSE-C are replaced by BSE-1N and BSE-2N, respectively.

[BSC] For state-owned buildings, the following specific procedures located in Appendix A may be used, without peer review, for their respective types of construction to comply with the seismic performance requirements for Risk Category I, II or III buildings:

1.Seismic Strengthening Provisions for Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings (Chapter A1).



2.Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Reinforced Concrete and Reinforced Masonry Wall Buildings with Flexible Diaphragms (Chapter A2).

319.1.2

When a design project is begun under Method B the selection of the peer reviewer is subject to the approval of the building official. Following approval by the peer reviewer, the seismic criteria for the project and the planned evaluation provisions must be approved by the building official. The approved seismic criteria and evaluation provisions shall apply. Upon approval of the building official these are permitted to be modified.

319.1.3

For state-owned and community college buildings, where unreinforced masonry is not bearing, it may be used only to resist applied lateral loads. Where unreinforced masonry walls are part of the structure they must be assessed for stability under the applicable nonstructural evaluation procedure.

319.1.4 Public schools.

[DSA-SS] For public schools, unreinforced masonry shall not be used to resist in-plane or out-of-plane seismic forces or superimposed gravity loads.

319.1.5 Public schools.

[DSA-SS] For public schools of light-frame construction, horizontal diaphragms and vertical shear walls shall consist of either diagonal lumber sheathing or structural panel sheathing. Braced horizontal diaphragms may be acceptable when approved by DSA. Straight lumber sheathing may be used in combination with diagonal or structural panel sheathing as diaphragms or shear walls. Let-in bracing, plaster (stucco), hollow clay tile, gypsum wallboard and particleboard sheathing shall not be assumed to resist seismic forces.

319.2 Existing conditions.

The existing condition and properties of the entire structure must be determined and documented by thorough inspection of the structure and site, review of all available related construction documents, review of geotechnical and engineering geologic reports, and performance of necessary testing and investigation. Where samples from the existing structure are taken or in situ tests are performed, they shall be selected and interpreted in a statistically appropriate manner to ensure that the properties determined and used in the evaluation or design are representative of the conditions and structural circumstances likely to be encountered in the structure as a whole. Adjacent structures or site features that may affect the retrofit design shall be identified.

The entire load path of the seismic-force-resisting system shall be determined, documented and evaluated. The load path includes all the horizontal and vertical elements participating in the structural response: such as diaphragms, diaphragm chords, diaphragm collectors, vertical elements such as walls frames, braces; foundations and the connections between the components and elements of the load path. Repaired or retrofitted elements and the standards under which the work was constructed shall be identified.

Data collection in accordance with ASCE 41 Section 6.2 shall meet the following minimum levels:

1.[BSC] For state-owned buildings, the requirements shall be met following the data collection requirements of ASCE 41, Section 6.2.

2.[DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC] For public schools and community college buildings constructed in conformance with the Field Act, the “Usual” level as defined in ASCE 41, Section 6.2.2.

3.[DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC] For public schools and community college buildings not constructed in conformance with the Field Act, the “Comprehensive” level as defined in ASCE 41, Section 6.2.3.

Concrete material requirements and testing for public school and community college buildings shall also comply with Sections 1911A and 1909.5 of the California Building Code, respectively.

Qualified test data from the original construction may be accepted, in part or in whole, by the enforcement agency to fulfill the data collection requirements.

Exceptions:

1.The number of samples for data collection may be adjusted with approval of the enforcement agency when it has been determined that adequate information has been obtained or additional information is required.

2.Welded steel moment frame connections of buildings that may have experienced potentially damaging ground motions shall be inspected in accordance with Chapters 3 and 4, FEMA 352, Recommended Post Earthquake Evaluation and Repair Criteria for Welded Moment-Frame Construction for Seismic Applications (July 2000).

Where original building plans and specifications are not available, “as-built” plans shall be prepared that depict the existing vertical and lateral structural systems, exterior elements, foundations and nonstructural systems in sufficient detail to complete the design.

Data collection shall be directed and observed by the project structural engineer or design professional in charge of the design.

319.3 Site geology and soil characteristics.

Soil profile shall be assigned in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 18 of the California Building Code.



319.4 Risk categories.

Each structure shall be placed in one of the Risk Categories in accordance with the requirements of the California Building Code.

319.5 Configuration requirements.

Each structure shall be designated structurally regular or irregular in accordance with the requirements of ASCE 41, Sections 7.3.1.1.1 to 7.3.1.1.4.

319.6 General selection of the design method.

The requirements of Method B (Section 321) may be used for any existing building.

319.7 Prescriptive selection of the design method.

The requirements of Method A (Section 320) or the specific procedures for applicable building types given in Section 319.1.1 are permitted to be used except under the following conditions, where the requirements of Method B (Section 321) must be used.

319.7.1

When the building contains prestressed or post-tensioned structural components (beams, columns, walls or slabs) or contains precast structural components (beams, columns, walls or flooring systems).

319.7.2

When the building is classified as irregular in vertical or horizontal plan. If the evaluation and retrofit is in accordance with Table 317.5 Footnote 2 or 3, the building shall be classified by application of ASCE 7, Section 12.3.2. If the evaluation and retrofit is in accordance with ASCE 41, the building shall be classified as irregular when an irregularity defined in ASCE 41, Sections 7.3.1.1.1 to 7.3.1.1.4 exists.



Exception: Section 319.7.2 does not apply in the following conditions:

1.The retrofit design removes the configurational attributes that caused the building to be classified as irregular.



2.The irregularity is demonstrated not to affect the seismic performance of the building.

319.7.3

For any building that is assigned to Risk Category IV.

319.7.4

For any building using undefined or hybrid structural systems.

319.7.5

When seismic isolation or energy dissipation systems are used in the retrofit or repair, either as part of the existing structure or as part of the modifications.

319.7.6

When the height of the structure exceeds 240 feet (73 152 mm).

319.7.7

When ASCE 41 is the evaluation standard and its application requires the use of nonlinear procedures.

319.8 Strength requirements.

All components of the lateral-force-resisting system must have the strength to meet the acceptance criteria prescribed in ASCE 41, Chapter 7 or as prescribed in the applicable Appendix A chapter of this code if a specific procedure in Section 319.1.1 is used. Any component not having this strength shall have its capacity increased by modifying or supplementing its strength so that it exceeds the demand, or the demand is reduced to less than the existing strength by making other modifications to the structural system.

Exception:  A component’s strength is permitted to be less than that required by the specified seismic load combinations if it can be demonstrated that the associated reduction in seismic performance of the component or its removal due to the failure does not result in a structural system that does not comply with the required performance objectives of Section 317. If this exception is taken for a component, then it cannot be considered part of the primary lateral-load-resisting system.

319.9 Nonstructural component requirements.

Where the nonstructural performance levels required by Section 317, Table 317.5 are N-D or higher, mechanical, electrical and plumbing components shall comply with the provisions of ASCE 41, Chapter 13, Section 13.2.

Exception:  Modifications to the procedures and criteria may be made subject to approval by the building official, and concurrence of the peer reviewer if applicable. All reports and correspondence shall also be forwarded to the building official.

319.10 Structural observation, testing and inspection.

Structural observation, testing and inspection as used in this section shall mean meeting the requirements of Chapter 17 of the California Building Code, with a minimum allowable level of investigation corresponding to seismic design category (SDC) D. Structural observation visits shall occur at  significant construction stages and at the completion of the structural retrofit. Structural observation shall be provided for all structures.



Additional requirements: [DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC] For public schools and community colleges, construction material testing, inspection and observation during construction shall also comply with the California Administrative Code.

319.10.1

The requirement for structural observation shall be noted and prominently displayed on the front sheet of the approved plans and incorporated into the general notes on the approved plans.

319.10.2 Preconstruction meeting.

A preconstruction meeting is mandatory for all projects which require structural observation. The meeting shall include, but is not limited to, the registered design professional, structural observer, general constructor, affected subcontractors, the project inspector and a representative of the enforcement agency (designated alternates may attend if approved by the structural observer). The structural observer shall schedule and coordinate this meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to identify and clarify all essential structural components and connections that affect the lateral and vertical load systems and to review scheduling of the required observations for the project’s structural system retrofit.

319.11 Temporary actions.

When compatible with the building use, and the time phasing for both use and the retrofit program, temporary shoring or other structural support is permitted to be considered. Temporary bracing, shoring and prevention of falling hazards are permitted to be used to qualify for Item 1 in Section 319.12 that allows inadequate capability in some existing components, as long as the required performance levels given in Section 317 can be provided by the permanent structure. The consideration for such temporary actions shall be noted in the design documents.

319.12 Voluntary modifications to the lateral-force resisting system.

Where modifications of existing structural components and additions of new structural components are initiated for the purpose of improving the lateral-force resisting strength or stiffness of an existing structure and they are not required by other sections of this code, then they are permitted to be designed to meet an approved seismic performance criteria provided that an engineering analysis is submitted that follows:

1.The capacity of existing structural components required to resist forces is not reduced, unless it can be demonstrated that reduced capacity meets the requirements of Section 319.8.

2.The lateral loading to or strength requirement of existing structural components is not increased beyond their capacity.

3.New structural components are detailed and connected to the existing structural components as required by the California Building Code.

4.New or relocated nonstructural components are detailed and connected to existing or new structural components as required by the California Building Code.

5.A dangerous condition is not created.

Use of ASCE 41 Tier 1 and Tier 2 deficiency only retrofit procedures are pre-approved for use where Section 317.3 does not require an assessment.

319.12.1 State-owned buildings.

[BSC] Voluntary modifications to lateral force-resisting systems conducted in accordance with Appendix A of this code and the referenced standards of the California Building Code shall be permitted.

319.12.1.1 Design documents.

[BSC] When Section 319.12 is the basis for structural modifications, the approved design documents must clearly state the scope of the seismic modifications and the accepted criteria for the design. The approved design documents must clearly have the phrase “The seismic requirements of the California Existing Building Code have not been checked to determine if these structural modifications meet the full seismic evaluation and strengthening requirements of Sections 317-322: the modifications proposed are to a different seismic performance standard than would be required in Section 319 if they were not voluntary as allowed in Section 319.12.”

319.12.2 Public schools and community colleges.

[DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC] When Section 319.12 is the basis for structural modifications, the approved design documents must clearly indicate the scope of modifications and the acceptance criteria for the design.

SECTION 320 METHOD A

320.1 General.

The retrofit design shall employ the Linear Static or Linear Dynamic Procedures of ASCE 41, Section 7.4.1 or 7.4.2, and comply with the applicable general requirements of ASCE 41, Chapters 6 and 7. The earthquake hazard level and performance level given specified in Section 317.5 for the building’s risk category shall be used. Structures shall be designed for seismic forces coming from any horizontal direction.

SECTION 321 METHOD B

321.1

The existing or retrofitted structure shall be demonstrated to have the capability to sustain the deformation response due to the specified earthquake ground motions and meet the seismic performance requirements of Section 317. The registered design professional shall provide an evaluation of the response of the existing structure in its modified configuration and condition to the ground motions specified. If the building’s seismic performance is evaluated as satisfactory and the peer reviewer(s) and the enforcement agency concurs, then no further structural retrofit and/or repair of the lateral load-resisting system is required.

When the evaluation indicates the building does not meet the required performance levels given in Table 317.5 for the risk category, then a retrofit and/or repair design shall be prepared that provides a structure that meets these performance objectives and reflects the appropriate consideration of existing conditions. Any approach to analysis and design is permitted to be used, provided that the approach shall be rational, shall be consistent with the established principals of mechanics and shall use the known performance characteristics of materials and assemblages under reversing loads typical of severe earthquake ground motions.

Exception:  Further consideration of the structure’s seismic performance may be waived by the enforcement agency if both the registered design professional and peer reviewer(s) conclude that the structural system can be expected to perform at least as well as required by the provisions of this section without completing an analysis of the structure’s compliance with these requirements. A detailed report shall be submitted to the responsible building official that presents the reasons and basis for this conclusion. This report shall be prepared by the registered design professional. The peer reviewer(s) shall concur in this conclusion and affirm to it in writing. The building official shall either approve this decision or require completion of the indicated work specified in this section prior to approval.

321.2

The approach, models, analysis procedures, assumptions on material and system behavior and conclusions shall be peer reviewed in accordance with the requirements of Section 322 and accepted by the peer reviewer(s).

Exceptions:

1.The enforcement agency may perform the work of peer review when qualified staff is available within the jurisdiction.

2.The enforcement agency may modify or waive the requirements for peer review when appropriate.

321.2.1

The approach used in the development of the design shall be acceptable to the peer reviewer and the enforcement agency and shall be the same method as used in the evaluation of the building. Approaches that are specifically tailored to the type of building, construction materials and specific building characteristics may be used, if they are acceptable to the independent peer reviewer. The use of Method A allowed procedures may also be used under Method B.

321.2.2

Any method of analysis may be used, subject to acceptance by the peer reviewer(s) and the building official. The general requirements given in ASCE 41, Chapters 6 and 7, shall be complied with unless exceptions are accepted by the peer reviewer(s) and building official. Use of other than ASCE 41 procedures in Method B requires building official concurrence before implementation.

321.2.3

Prior to implementation, the procedures, methods, material assumptions and acceptance/rejection criteria proposed by the registered design professional will be peer reviewed as provided in Section 322. Where nonlinear procedures are used, prior to any analysis, the representation of the seismic ground motion shall be reviewed and approved by the peer reviewer(s) and the building official.

[DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC] For public school and community college projects, the representation of the seismic ground motion shall be reviewed and approved by the California Geological Survey.

321.2.4

The conclusions and design decisions shall be reviewed and accepted by the peer reviewer(s) and the building official.
