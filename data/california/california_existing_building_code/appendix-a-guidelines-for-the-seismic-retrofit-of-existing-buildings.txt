CHAPTER A2 EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN EXISTING REINFORCED CONCRETE AND REINFORCED MASONRY  WALL BUILDINGS WITH FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGMS

SECTION A201 PURPOSE

[BS] A201.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury as a result of the effects of earthquakes on reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry wall buildings with flexible diaphragms. Based on past earthquakes, these buildings have been categorized as being potentially hazardous and prone to significant damage, including possible collapse in a moderate to major earthquake. The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury on both subject and adjacent properties. These provisions will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury, or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building that complies with these standards.

SECTION A202 SCOPE

[BS] A202.1 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to wall anchorage systems that resist out-of-plane forces and to collectors in existing reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry buildings with flexible diaphragms. Wall anchorage systems that were designed and constructed in accordance with the 1997 Uniform Building Code or the 2001 or subsequent editions of the California Building Code shall be deemed to comply with these provisions.

SECTION A203 DEFINITIONS

[BS] A203.1 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the applicable definitions in the California Building Code and the following shall apply:

[BS]CONTINUITY CONNECTOR. A component, typically a plate, rod, strap or hold-down, that ensures load path
continuity along the full length of a crosstie or strut.

The provisions of this chapter are intended to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of earthquake-induced damage to existing wood-frame residential buildings. The requirements contained in this chapter are prescriptive minimum standards intended to improve the seismic performance of residential buildings; however, they will not necessarily prevent earthquake damage.

This chapter sets standards for strengthening that may be approved by the code official without requiring plans or calculations prepared by a registered design professional. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not prescribed herein. The code official may require that construction documents for strengthening using alternative materials or methods be prepared by a registered design professional.

[BS] A301.2 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter apply to residential buildings of light-frame wood construction containing one or more of the structural weaknesses specified in Section A303.

Exception: The provisions of this chapter do not apply to the buildings, or elements thereof, listed as follows. These buildings or elements require analysis by a registered design professional in accordance with Section A301.3 to determine appropriate strengthening:

CHAPTER A4 EARTHQUAKE RISK REDUCTION IN WOOD-FRAME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WITH SOFT, WEAK OR OPEN FRONT WALLS

SECTION A401 GENERAL

[BS] A401.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to promote public welfare and safety by reducing the risk of death or injury as a result of the effects of earthquakes on existing wood-frame, multiple-unit residential buildings. The ground motions of past earthquakes have caused the loss of human life, personal injury and property damage in these types of buildings. This chapter creates minimum standards to strengthen the more vulnerable portions of these structures. Where fully followed, these minimum standards will improve the performance of these buildings but will not necessarily prevent all earthquake-related damage.

[BS] A401.2 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter apply to
existing buildings of wood construction that contain residential occupancies and are assigned to Risk Category II, and
where the structure has a soft, weak or open-front wall line,
and there exists one or more stories above.

SECTION A402 DEFINITIONS

[BS] A402.1 Definitions.

Notwithstanding the applicable definitions, symbols and notations in the building code, the following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this chapter:

[BS] ASPECT RATIO. The span-width ratio for horizontal diaphragms and the height-length ratio for shear walls.



[BS] NONCONFORMING STRUCTURAL MATERIALS. Wall bracing materials other than wood structural panels or diagonal sheathing.

[BS] OPEN-FRONT WALL LINE. An exterior wall line, without vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, that requires tributary seismic forces to be resisted by diaphragm rotation or excessive cantilever beyond parallel lines of shear walls. Diaphragms that cantilever more than 25 percent of the distance between lines of lateral force-resisting elements from which the diaphragm cantilevers shall be considered to be excessive. Exterior exit balconies of 6 feet (1829 mm) or less in width shall not be considered excessive cantilevers.

[BS] RETROFIT. An improvement of the lateral force-resisting system by alteration of existing structural elements or addition of new structural elements.

[BS] SOFT WALL LINE. A wall line whose lateral stiffness is less than that required by story drift limitations or deformation compatibility requirements of this chapter. In lieu of analysis, a soft wall line may be defined as a wall line in a story where the story stiffness is less than 70 percent of the story above for the direction under consideration.

[BS] STORY. A story as defined by the building code, including any basement or underfloor space of a building with cripple walls exceeding 4 feet (1219 mm) in height.



[BS] WALL LINE. Any length of wall along a principal axis of the building used to provide resistance to lateral loads. Parallel wall lines separated by less than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall be considered to be one wall line for the distribution of loads.

[BS] WEAK WALL LINE. A wall line in a story where the story strength is less than 80 percent of the story above in the direction under consideration.

SECTION A403 ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

[BS] A403.1 General.

Modifications required by the provisions in this chapter shall be designed in accordance with the California Building Code provisions for new construction, except as modified by this chapter.

Exception: Buildings for which the prescriptive measures provided in Section A404 apply and are used.

Alteration of the existing lateral force-resisting system or vertical load-carrying system shall not reduce the strength or stiffness of the existing structure, unless the altered structure would remain in conformance to the building code and this chapter.

[BS] A403.2 Scope of analysis.

This chapter requires the alteration, repair, replacement or addition of structural elements and their connections to meet the strength and stiffness requirements herein. The lateral load-path analysis shall include the resisting elements and connections from the wood diaphragm immediately above any soft, weak or open-front wall lines to the foundation soil interface or to the uppermost story of a podium structure comprised of steel, masonry, or concrete structural systems that supports the upper wood-framed structure. Stories above the uppermost story with a soft, weak or open-front wall line shall be considered in the analysis but need not be modified. The lateral load-path analysis for added structural elements shall include evaluation of the allowable soil-bearing and lateral pressures in accordance with the building code. Where any portion of a building within the scope of this chapter is constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33-percent slope), the lateral force-resisting system at and below the base level diaphragm shall be analyzed for the effects of concentrated lateral forces at the base caused by this hillside condition.



[BS] A403.3 Design base shear and design parameters.

The design base shear in a given direction shall be permitted to be 75 percent of the value required for similar new construction in accordance with the building code. The value of R used in the design of the strengthening of any story shall not exceed the lowest value of R used in the same direction at any story above. The system overstrength factor, Ω0, and the deflection amplification factor, Cd, shall be not less than the largest respective value corresponding to the R factor being used in the direction under consideration.

Exceptions:

1.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category B, values of R, Ω0 and Cd shall be permitted to be based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening.

2.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C or D, values of R, Ω0 and Cd shall be permitted to be based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening, provided that when the strengthening is complete, the strengthened structure will not have an extreme weak story irregularity defined as Type 5b in ASCE 7 Table 12.3-2.

3.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category E, values of R, Ω0 and Cd shall be permitted to be  based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening, provided that when the strengthening is complete, the strengthened structure will not have an extreme soft story, a weak story, or an extreme weak story irregularity defined, respectively, as Types 1b, 5a and 5b in ASCE 7 Table 12.3-2.

4.For retrofit systems involving different seismic force-resisting systems in the same direction within the same story, resisting elements are permitted to be designed using the least value of R for the different structural systems found in each independent line of resistance if all of the following conditions are met:

4.1.The building is assigned to Risk Category I
or II.

4.2.The building height is no more than four stories above grade plane.

4.3.The seismic force-resisting systems of the retrofitted building comprise only wood structural panel shear walls, steel momentresisting frames, steel cantilever columns and steel-braced frames. Values for C and Ω 0 shall be consistent with the R value used.

5.With reference to ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1, ordinary,
intermediate and special steel systems, and all lightframe systems shall be permitted without limitation
where those systems are used only for retrofit to
comply with the requirements of this chapter.

[BS] A403.3.1 Expected story strength.

Despite any
other requirement of Section A403.3 or A403.4, the total
expected strength of retrofit elements added to any story
need not exceed 1.7 times the expected strength of the
story immediately above in a two-story building, or 1.3
times the expected strength of the story immediately above
in a three-story or taller building, as long as the retrofit elements are located symmetrically about the center of
mass of the story above, or so as to minimize torsion in the
retrofitted story. Calculation of expected story strength
and identification of irregularities in Section A403.3 shall
be based on the expected strength of all wall lines, even if
sheathed with nonconforming materials. The strength of a
wall line above the retrofitted story shall be permitted to
be reduced to account for inadequate load path or overturning resistance.

[BS] A403.3.2 Seismicity parameters, site class and
geologic hazards.

For any site designated as Site Class E,
the value of F shall be taken as 1.2. Site-specific procedures are not required for compliance with this chapter.
Mitigation of existing geologic site hazards such as liquefiable soil, fault rupture or landslide is not required for
compliance with this chapter.

[BS] A403.4 Story drift limitations.

The calculated story drift for each retrofitted story shall not exceed the allowable deformation compatible with all vertical load-resisting elements and 0.025 times the story height. The calculated story drift shall not be reduced by the effects of horizontal diaphragm stiffness but shall be increased where these effects produce rotation. Drift calculations shall be in accordance with the building code.

[BS] A403.4.1 Pole structures.

The effects of rotation and soil stiffness shall be included in the calculated story drift where lateral loads are resisted by vertical elements whose required depth of embedment is determined by pole formulas. The coefficient of subgrade reaction used in deflection calculations shall be based on a geotechnical investigation conducted in accordance with the building code.

[BS] A403.5 Deformation compatibility and P Δ effects.

The requirements of the building code shall apply, except as modified herein. Structural framing elements and their connections not required by design to be part of the lateral force-resisting system shall be designed and detailed to be adequate to maintain support of expected gravity loads when subjected to the expected deformations caused by seismic forces. Increased demand caused by P Δ effects and story sidesway stability shall be considered in retrofit stories that rely on the strength and stiffness of cantilever columns for lateral resistance.

where it is shown that the condition occurs in areas small enough not to affect overall building performance.

2.For all other diaphragms adequate strength shall be
shown to be provided at locations where forces are
transferred between the diaphragm and each new or
strengthened vertical element of the seismic forceresisting system. Collector elements shall be provided
where needed to distribute the transferred force over a
greater length of diaphragm.

Exception: Where the existing vertical elements of
the seismic force-resisting system are shown to
comply with this chapter, diaphragms need not be
evaluated.

[BS] A403.9 Wood-framed shear walls.

Wood-framed
shear walls shall have strength and stiffness sufficient to
resist the seismic loads and shall conform to the requirements
of this section. Where new sheathing is applied to existing
studs to create new wood-framed shear walls, the new wall
elements shall be considered bearing wall systems for
purposes of determining seismic design parameters.

[BS] A403.9.1 Gypsum or cement plaster products.

Gypsum or cement plaster products shall not be used to
provide the strength required by Section A403.3 or the stiffness required by Section A403.4.

[BS] A403.9.2 Wood structural panels.

Wood structural panel shear walls shall meet the story drift limitation of Section A403.4. Conformance to the story drift limitation shall be determined by approved testing or calculation. Individual shear panels shall be permitted to exceed the maximum aspect ratio, provided that the allowable story drift and allowable shear capacities are not exceeded.

[BS] A403.9.2.2 Openings.

Shear walls are permitted to be designed for continuity around openings in accordance with the building code. Blocking and steel strapping shall be provided at corners of the openings to transfer forces from discontinuous boundary elements into adjoining panel elements. Alternatively, perforated shear wall provisions of the building code are permitted to be used.

[BS] A403.9.3 Hold-down connectors.

[BS] A403.9.3.1 Expansion anchors in tension.

Expansion anchors that provide tension strength by friction resistance shall not be used to connect hold-down devices to existing concrete or masonry elements.

[BS] A403.9.3.2 Required depth of embedment.

The required depth of embedment or edge distance for the anchor used in the hold-down connector shall be provided in the concrete or masonry below any plain concrete slab unless satisfactory evidence is submitted to the code official that shows that the concrete slab and footings are of monolithic construction.

A403.10 Steel retrofit systems.

Steel retrofit systems shall
have strength and stiffness sufficient to resist the seismic
loads and shall conform to the requirements of this section.

A403.10.1 Special moment frames.

Steel special moment
frames shall comply with all applicable provisions of
AISC 341, except that Section E3.4a addressing strongcolumn/weak-beams of AISC 341, is not required for
columns that carry no gravity load.
