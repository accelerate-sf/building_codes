In each code development cycle, proposed changes to this code are considered at the Committee Action Hearings by the International Existing Building Code Development Committee. Proposed changes to a code section having a number beginning with a letter in brackets are considered by a different code development committee. For example, proposed changes to code sections that are preceded by the designation [F] (e.g., [F] 1504.2) are considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee at the Committee Action Hearings.

The content of sections in this code that begin with a letter designation is maintained by another code development committee in accordance with the following:

[A]	=	Administrative Code Development Committee;
[BE]	=	IBC – Means of Egress Code Development Committee;
[BG]	=	IBC – General Code Development Committee;
[BS]	=	IBC – Structural Code Development Committee;
[E]	=	International Commercial Energy Conservation Code Development Committee or International Residential Energy Conservation Code Development Committee;
[F]	=	International Fire Code Development Committee;
[FG]	=	International Fuel Gas Code Development Committee;
[M]	=	International Mechanical Code Development Committee; and
[P]	=	International Plumbing Code Development CommitteeFor the development of the 2024 edition of the I-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years, as shown in the following Code Development Hearings Table.

Code change proposals submitted for code sections that have a letter designation in front of them will be heard by the respective committee responsible for such code sections. Because different committees hold Committee Action Hearings in different years, it is possible that some proposals for this code will be heard by a committee in a different year than the year in which the primary committee for this code meets. In the case of the IEBC, the primary committees that maintain this code will meet in 2022.

For instance, Section 1501.3 is designated as the responsibility of the IBC—General Code Development Committee. This committee will conduct its code development hearings in 2021 to consider all code change proposals to the International Building Code and any portions of other codes that it is responsible for, including Section 1501.3 of the IEBC and other general provisions of the IEBC (designated with [BG] in front of those sections). Therefore, any proposals received for Section 1501.3 will be considered in 2021 by the IBC—General Code Development Committee.

It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understand which code development committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal.
