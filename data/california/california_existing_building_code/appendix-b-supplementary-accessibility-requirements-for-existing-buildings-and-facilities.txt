APPENDIX B SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

User note:

About this appendix: Chapter 11 of the International Building Code® contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility to buildings and their associated sites and facilities for people with physical disabilities. Sections 306 and 1508 in the code address accessibility provisions and alternatives permitted in existing buildings. Appendix B was added to address accessibility in construction for items that are not typically enforceable through the traditional building code enforcement process.

[BE] B101.1 General.

Qualified historic buildings and facilities shall comply with Sections B101.2 through B101.5.

[BE] B101.2 Qualified historic buildings and facilities.

These procedures shall apply to buildings and facilities designated as historic structures that undergo alterations or a change of occupancy.

[BE] B101.3 Qualified historic buildings and facilities subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

Where an alteration or change of occupancy is undertaken to a qualified historic building or facility that is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the federal agency with jurisdiction over the undertaking shall follow the Section 106 process. Where the state historic preservation officer or Advisory Council on Historic Preservation determines that compliance with the requirements for accessible routes, ramps, entrances, or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the alternative requirements of Section 306.7.16 for that element are permitted.

[BE] B101.4 Qualified historic buildings and facilities not subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

Where an alteration or change of occupancy is undertaken to a qualified historic building or facility that is not subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and the entity undertaking the alterations believes that compliance with the requirements for accessible routes, ramps, entrances or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the entity shall consult with the state historic preservation officer. Where the state historic preservation officer determines that compliance with the accessibility requirements for accessible routes, ramps, entrances or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historical significance of the building or facility, the alternative requirements of Section 306.7.16 for that element are permitted.

[BE] B101.4.1 Consultation with interested persons.

Interested persons shall be invited to participate in the consultation process, including state or local accessibility officials, individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing individuals with disabilities.

[BE] B101.4.2 Certified local government historic preservation programs.

Where the state historic preservation officer has delegated the consultation responsibility for purposes of this section to a local government historic preservation program that has been certified in accordance with Section 101 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 [(16 U.S.C. 470a(c)] and implementing regulations (36 CFR 61.5), the responsibility shall be permitted to be carried out by the appropriate local government body or official.
