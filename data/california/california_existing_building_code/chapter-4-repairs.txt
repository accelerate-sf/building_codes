CHAPTER 4 REPAIRS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 4 provides requirements for repairs of existing buildings. The provisions define conditions under which repairs may be made using materials and methods like those of the original construction or the extent to which repairs must comply with requirements for new buildings.

SECTION 401 GENERAL

401.1 Scope.

Repairs shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. Repairs to historic buildings need only comply with Chapter 12. [OSHPD 1R, 2, 4 & 5] Repairs to historic buildings not adopted by OSHPD shall comply with the requirements in the California Building Code, Sections 1224.2, 1225.2, 1226.2, 1227.2 and 1228.2 for functional requirements.

401.1.1 Bleachers, grandstands and folding and telescopic seating.

Repairs to existing bleachers, grandstands and folding and telescopic seating shall comply with ICC 300.

401.1.2 Scope.

[BSC] For state-owned buildings, including those owned by the University of California and the California State University and the Judicial Council, the requirements of Sections 405.2.1 and 405.2.3 are replaced by the requirements of Sections 317 through 322.

401.2 Compliance.

The work shall not make the building less complying than it was before the repair was undertaken.



[BS] 401.3 Flood hazard areas.

In flood hazard areas, repairs that constitute substantial improvement shall require that the building comply with Section 1612 of the California Building Code, or Section R322 of the California Residential Code, as applicable.

SECTION 402 BUILDING ELEMENTS AND MATERIALS

402.1 Glazing in hazardous locations.

Replacement glazing in hazardous locations shall comply with the safety glazing requirements of the California Building Code or California Residential Code as applicable.

Exception:  Glass block walls, louvered windows and jalousies repaired with like materials.

402.2 402.2 Existing materials. Existing materials.

[HCD] Existing materials shall comply with Section 302.3.

402.3 New and replacement materials.

New and replacement materials used for repairs shall comply with Section 302.4.

SECTION 403 FIRE PROTECTION

403.1 General.

Repairs shall be done in a manner that maintains the level of fire protection provided.

SECTION 404 MEANS OF EGRESS

404.1 General.

Repairs shall be done in a manner that maintains the level of protection provided for the means of egress.

SECTION 405 STRUCTURAL

[BS] 405.1 General.

Structural repairs shall be in compliance with this section and Section 401.2.

[BS] 405.2 Repairs to damaged buildings.

Repairs to damaged buildings shall comply with this section.

[BS] 405.2.1 Repairs for less than substantial structural damage.

Unless otherwise required by this section, for damage less than substantial structural damage, the damaged elements shall be permitted to be restored to their predamage condition.

[BS] 405.2.1.1 Snow damage.

Structural components whose damage was caused by or related to snow load effects shall be repaired, replaced or altered to satisfy the requirements of Section 1608 of the California Building Code.

[BS] 405.2.2 Disproportionate earthquake damage.

A building assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F that has sustained disproportionate earthquake damage shall be subject to the requirements for buildings with substantial structural damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system.

[BS] 405.2.3 Substantial structural damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system.

A building that has sustained substantial structural damage to the vertical elements of its lateral force-resisting system shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 405.2.3.1, and either repaired in accordance with Section 405.2.3.2 or repaired and retrofitted in accordance with Section 405.2.3.3, depending on the results of the evaluation.

Exceptions:

1.Buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category A, B or C whose substantial structural damage was not caused by earthquake need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.

2.One- and two-family dwellings need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.

[BS] 405.2.3.1 Evaluation.

The building shall be evaluated by a registered design professional, and the evaluation findings shall be submitted to the code official. The evaluation shall establish whether the damaged building, if repaired to its predamage state, would comply with the provisions of the California Building Code for load combinations that include wind or earthquake effects, except that the seismic forces shall be the reduced seismic forces.

[BS] 405.2.3.2 Extent of repair for compliant buildings.

If the evaluation establishes that the building in its predamage condition complies with the provisions of Section 405.2.3.1, then the damaged elements shall be permitted to be restored to their predamage condition.

[BS] 405.2.3.3 Extent of repair for noncompliant buildings.

If the evaluation does not establish that the building in its predamage condition complies with the provisions of Section 405.2.3.1, then the building shall be retrofitted to comply with the provisions of this section. The wind loads for the repair and retrofit shall be those required by the building code in effect at the time of original construction, unless the damage was caused by wind, in which case the wind loads shall be in accordance with the California Building Code. The seismic loads for this retrofit design shall be those required by the building code in effect at the time of original construction, but not less than the reduced seismic forces.

[BS] 405.2.4 Substantial structural damage to gravity load-carrying components.

Gravity load-carrying components that have sustained substantial structural damage shall be rehabilitated to comply with the applicable provisions for dead, live and snow loads in the California Building Code. Undamaged gravity load-carrying components that receive dead, live or snow loads from rehabilitated components shall also be rehabilitated if required to comply with the design loads of the rehabilitation design.

[BS] 405.2.4.1 Lateral force-resisting elements.

Regardless of the level of damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, if substantial structural damage to gravity load-carrying components was caused primarily by wind or seismic effects, then the building shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 405.2.3.1 and, if noncompliant, retrofitted in accordance with Section 405.2.3.3.

Exceptions:

1.Buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category A, B or C whose substantial structural damage was not caused by earthquake need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.

2.One- and two-family dwellings need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.

[BS] 405.2.5 Substantial structural damage to snow load-carrying components.

Where substantial structural damage to any snow load-carrying components is caused by or related to snow load effects, any components required to carry snow loads on roof framing of similar construction shall be repaired, replaced or retrofitted to satisfy the requirements of Section 1608 of the California Building Code.

[BS] 405.2.6 Flood hazard areas.

In flood hazard areas, buildings that have sustained substantial damage shall be brought into compliance with Section 1612 of the California Building Code, or Section R322 of the California Residential Code, as applicable.
