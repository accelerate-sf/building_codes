APPENDIX C: GUIDELINES FOR THE WIND RETROFIT OF EXISTING BUILDINGS

CHAPTER C1 GABLE END RETROFIT FOR HIGH-WIND AREAS

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix C is intended to provide guidance for retrofitting existing structures to strengthen their resistance to wind forces. This appendix is similar in scope to Appendix A, which addresses seismic retrofits for existing buildings, except that the subject matter is related to wind retrofits. These retrofits are voluntary measures that serve to better protect the public and reduce damage from high-wind events for existing buildings.

The purpose of this appendix is to provide prescriptive alternatives for addressing retrofit of buildings in high-wind areas. Currently there are two chapters that deal with the retrofit of gable ends and the fastening of roof decks, Appendix Chapters C1 and C2, respectively.

SECTION C101 GENERAL

[BS] C101.1 Purpose

This chapter provides prescriptive methods for partial structural retrofit of an existing building to increase its resistance to out-of-plane wind loads. It is intended for voluntary use and for reference by mitigation programs. The provisions of this chapter do not necessarily satisfy requirements for new construction. Unless specifically cited, the provisions of this chapter do not necessarily satisfy requirements for structural improvements triggered by addition, alteration, repair, change of occupancy, building relocation or other circumstances.

[BS] C101.2 Eligible buildings and gable end walls

The provisions of this chapter are applicable only to buildings that meet the following eligibility requirements:

1.The building is not more than three stories tall, from adjacent grade to the bottom plate of each gable end wall being retrofitted with this chapter.

2.The building is classified as Occupancy Group R3 or is within the scope of the California Residential Code.

3.The structure includes one or more wood-framed gable end walls, either conventionally framed or metal-plate-connected.

In addition, the provisions of this chapter are applicable only to gable end walls that meet the following eligibility requirements:

4.Each gable end wall has or shall be provided with studs or vertical webs spaced 24 inches (610 mm) on center maximum.

5.Each gable end wall has a maximum height of 16 feet (4877 mm).

[BS] C101.3 Compliance

Eligible gable end walls in eligible buildings may be retrofitted in accordance with this chapter. Other modifications required for compliance with this chapter shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the California Building Code or California Residential Code provisions for new construction, except as specifically provided for by this chapter.

SECTION C102 DEFINITIONS

[BS] C102.1 Definitions.

The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this chapter, have the meanings shown herein.

[BS] ANCHOR BLOCK. A piece of lumber secured to horizontal braces and filling the gap between existing framing members for the purpose of restraining horizontal braces from movement perpendicular to the framing members.

[BS] COMPRESSION BLOCK. A piece of lumber used to restrain in the compression mode (force directed toward the interior of the attic) an existing or retrofit stud. It is attached to a horizontal brace and bears directly against the existing or retrofit stud.

[BS] CONVENTIONALLY FRAMED GABLE END. A gable end framed with studs whose faces are perpendicular to the gable end wall.

[BS] GABLE END FRAME. A factory or site-fabricated frame, installed as a complete assembly that incorporates vertical webs with their faces parallel to the plane of the frame.

[BS] HORIZONTAL BRACE. A piece of lumber used to restrain both compression and tension loads applied by a retrofit stud. It is typically installed horizontally on the top of attic floor framing members (truss bottom chords or ceiling joists) or on the bottom of pitched roof framing members (truss top chord or rafters).

[BS] HURRICANE TIES. Manufactured metal connectors designed to provide uplift and lateral restraint for roof framing members.

[BS] NAIL PLATE. A manufactured metal plate made of galvanized steel with factory-punched holes for fasteners. A nail plate may have the geometry of a strap.

[BS] RETROFIT. The voluntary process of strengthening or improving buildings or structures, or individual components of buildings or structures for the purpose of making existing conditions better serve the purpose for which they were originally intended or the purpose that current building codes intend.

[BS] RETROFIT STUD. A lumber member used to structurally supplement an existing gable end wall stud or gable end frame web.

[BS] C104.2.9 Piggyback gable end frames

Piggyback gable end frames (gable end frames built in two sections one above the other) shall be permitted to be retrofitted if either of the following cases is true:

1.The existing studs in both the upper gable end frames and the lower gable end frames to which wall sheathing, panel siding, or other wall covering are attached are sufficiently in line that retrofit studs can be installed and connections made between the two with retrofit stud(s).

2.Existing studs in the upper frame are not sufficiently in line with the studs in the frame below and the existing studs in the upper frame are 3 feet (91 cm) or shorter.

For Condition 1 both the lower stud and the upper stud shall be retrofitted using the methods of Section C104.2. For Condition 2 the retrofit stud shall be connected to the lower studs using the methods of Section C104.2 and be continuous from the bottom horizontal brace to the top horizontal brace. Connection is not required between the retrofit stud and the upper stud. In both conditions the bottom chord of the piggyback truss section shall be fastened to each retrofit stud using a connector with minimum axial capacity of 175 pounds (778 N).

[BS] C104.3 Retrofit studs

Retrofit studs shall be installed in accordance with Section C104.3.1 using one of the five methods of Sections C104.3.2, C104.3.3, C104.3.4, C104.3.5 or C104.3.6. Figure C104.3 shows these methods of installation. For the Retrofit Configuration obtained from Table C104.2, the size of retrofit studs shall be as indicated in Table C104.4.1 or Table C104.4.2. Retrofit studs shall extend from the top of the lower horizontal brace to the bottom of the upper horizontal brace except that a maximum gap of 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) is permitted at the bottom and 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) at the top. Where wall sheathing, panel siding or other wall covering is fastened to a conventionally framed gable end, retrofit studs shall be applied in accordance with Section C104.2.1.
