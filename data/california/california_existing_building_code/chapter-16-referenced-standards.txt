CHAPTER 16 REFERENCED STANDARDS

User note:

About this chapter: This code contains numerous references to standards that are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 16 contains a comprehensive list of all standards that are referenced in the code, including the appendices. The standards are part of the code to the extent of the reference to the standard. Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the building code official, contractor, designer and owner.

This chapter lists the standards that are referenced in various sections of this document. The standards are listed herein by the promulgating agency of the standard, the standard identification, the effective date and title, and the section or sections of this document that reference the standard. The application of the referenced standards shall be as specified in Section 102.4, or California Administration Division 1, as applicable. [OSHPD 1] Reference to other chapters. In addition to the code sections referenced, the standards listed in this chapter are applicable to the respective code sections in Chapters 2, 3A, 4A and 5A.
