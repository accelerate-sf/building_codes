PREFACE

Given that land use and planning are largely regulated locally, cities, counties and cities and counties should consider reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with development through local land-use practices in conjunction with enforcing the provisions of this code. Specific land use strategies a city, county or city and county may wish to consider include but are not limited to the following:

Site selection. Develop sites for buildings, hardscape, roads or parking areas consistent with the local general plan and regional transportation plan pursuant to SB 375 (Stats. 2008, Ch. 728).

Regional sustainable communities strategy. Site selection and building design and use shall conform the project with the prevailing regional sustainable communities strategy or alternative planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the California Air Resources Board pursuant to SB375 (Stats. 2008, Ch. 728), including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities.

Transit priority projects. To qualify as a transit priority project, the project shall meet three criteria:

(1)(a) contain at least 50 percent residential use, based on total building square footage and, if the project contains between 26 and 50 percent nonresidential uses, a floor area ratio of not less than 0.75; (b) provide a minimum net density of at least 20 dwelling units per acre; and (c) be within one-half mile of a major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor included in a regional transportation plan as described in Section 21155 of Stats. 2008, Ch. 728;

(2)be consistent with the prevailing sustainable communities strategy or alternative planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the California Air Resources Board, including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities; and

(3)have all necessary entitlements required by the applicable local government.

Notes:

1. If the postconsumer and preconsumer recycled content is provided in pounds, Equation A5.4-7 may be used, but the final result (in pounds) must be multiplied by 100 to show RCM as a percentage.

2. If the manufacturer does not separately identify the pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, the total amount shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.

A5.405.4.4 Determination of recycled content value of assemblies – (RCVA).

Recycled content value of assemblies is calculated by multiplying the total cost of assembly by the total recycled content of the assembly (RCA), and shall be determined by Equation A5.4-8.

If not provided by the manufacturer, Total RCA (percent) is the sum (Σ) of the Proportional Recycled Content (PRCM) of each material in the assembly. RCA shall be determined by Equation A4.4-9.

PRCM of each material may be calculated by one of two methods using the following formulas:

Method 1: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) of each material provided in percentages
(Equation A5.4-10)
(Equation A5.4-11)
(See Equation A5.4-7)

Method 2: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) provided in pounds
(Equation A5.4-12)
(Equation A5.4-13)
Note: If the manufacturer does not separately identify the pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, the total amount shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.

Note: If the manufacturer does not separately identify the pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, the total amount shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.
Method 1: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) of each material provided in percentages

Method 2: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) provided in pounds

Note: If the manufacturer does not separately identify the pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, the total amount shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.
Note: If the manufacturer does not separately identify the pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, the total amount shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.

1. Ventilation during construction shall be achieved through openings in the building shell using fans to produce a minimum of three air changes per hour.

2. If the building is occupied during demolition or construction, meet or exceed the recommended Control Measures of the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association (SMACNA) IAQ Guidelines for Occupied Buildings under Construction, 1995, Chapter 3.

A5.504.1.2 Additional IAQ measures.

Employ additional measures as follows:

1. When using generators to generate temporary power, use generators meeting the requirements of CCR, Title 13, Chapter 9 or local ordinance, whichever is more stringent.

2. Protect on-site absorbent materials from moisture. Remove and replace any materials with evidence of mold, mildew or moisture infiltration.

3. Store odorous and high VOC-emitting materials offsite, without packaging, for a sufficient period to allow odors and VOCs to disperse.

4. When possible, once materials are on the jobsite, install odorous and high VOC-emitting materials prior to those that are porous or fibrous.

5. Clean oil and dust from ducts prior to use.

A5.504.2 IAQ postconstruction.

After all interior finishes have been installed, flush out the building by supplying continuous ventilation with all air handling units at their maximum outdoor air rate and all supply fans at their maximum position and rate for at least 14 days.

1. During this time, maintain an internal temperature of at least 60°F and relative humidity no higher than 60 percent. If extenuating circumstances make these temperature and humidity limits unachievable, the flushout may be conducted under conditions as close as possible to these limits, provided that documentation of the extenuating circumstances is provided in writing.

2. Occupancy may start after 4 days, provided flush-out continues for the full 14 days. During occupied times, the thermal comfort conditions of Title 24 must be met.

3. For buildings that rely on natural ventilation, exhaust fans and floor fans must be used to improve air mixing and removal during the 14-day flush-out and windows should remain open.

4. Do not “bake out” the building by increasing the temperature of the space.

5. If continuous ventilation is not possible, flush-out air must total the equivalent of 14 days of maximum outdoor air. The equivalent of 14 days of maximum outdoor air (the target air volume) shall be calculated by multiplying the maximum feasible air flow rate (in ft3/m) by 14 days (20,160 minutes). The air volumes for each period of ventilation are then calculated and summed and the flush-out continues until the total equals the target air volume.

A5.504.2.1 IAQ testing.

A5.504.2.1.2 Test protocols.

Testing of indoor air quality should include the following elements:

1. The contaminant sampling and averaging times and the measurement methods should be sufficient to achieve a Limit of Detection that is below the maximum allowable concentrations.

2. Testing should be conducted with the HVAC system operated at the minimum design outdoor air ventilation rate.

3. Air samplers and monitors should be located near likely sources of formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds, at a height of 3 to 6 feet from the floor and well away from walls and air diffusers.

4. The test protocols should be justified with documentation to show that appropriate sampling methods and times were used.

A5.504.2.1.3 Noncomplying building areas.

For each sampling area of the building exceeding the maximum concentrations specified in Section A5.504.2.1.1, flush out with outside air and retest samples taken from the same area. Repeat the procedures until testing demonstrates compliance.
