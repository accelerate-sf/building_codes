SECTION 5.106 SITE DEVELOPMENT

5.106.1 Stormwater pollution prevention for projects that disturb less than one acre of land.

Newly constructed projects and additions which disturb less than one acre of land and are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale shall prevent the pollution of stormwater runoff from the construction activities through one or more of the following measures:

5.106.1.1 Local ordinance.

Comply with a lawfully enacted stormwater management and/or erosion control ordinance.

5.106.1.2 Best management practices (BMP’s).

Prevent the loss of soil through wind or water erosion by implementing an effective combination of erosion and sediment control and good housekeeping BMP’s.

1.Soil loss BMP’s that should be considered for implementation as appropriate for each project include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.Scheduling construction activity during dry weather, when possible.

b.Preservation of natural features, vegetation, soil and buffers around surface waters.

c.Drainage swales or lined ditches to control stormwater flow.

d.Mulching or hydroseeding to stabilize disturbed soils.

e.Erosion control to protect slopes.

f.Protection of storm drain inlets (gravel bags or catch basin inserts).

g.Perimeter sediment control (perimeter silt fence, fiber rolls).

h.Sediment trap or sediment basin to retain sediment on site.

i.Stabilized construction exits.

j.Wind erosion control.

k.Other soil loss BMP’s acceptable to the enforcing agency.

2.Good housekeeping BMP’s to manage construction equipment, materials, non-stormwater discharges and wastes that should be considered for implementation as appropriate for each project include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.Dewatering activities.

b.Material handling and waste management.

c.Building materials stockpile management.

d.Management of washout areas (concrete, paints, stucco, etc.).

e.Control of vehicle/equipment fueling to contractor’s staging area.

f.Vehicle and equipment cleaning performed off site.

g.Spill prevention and control.

5.106.2 Stormwater pollution prevention for projects that disturb one or more acres of land.

Comply with all lawfully enacted stormwater discharge regulations for projects that (1) disturb one acre or more of land, or (2) disturb less than one acre of land but are part of a larger common plan of development or sale.

Note: Projects that (1) disturb one acre or more of land, or (2) disturb less than one acre of land but are part of a larger common plan of development or sale must comply with the postconstruction requirements detailed in the applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction and Land Disturbance Activities issued by the State Water Resources Control Board or the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (for projects in the Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit).

The NPDES permits require postconstruction runoff (postproject hydrology) to match the preconstruction runoff (pre-project hydrology) with the installation of postconstruction stormwater management measures. The NPDES permits emphasize runoff reduction through on-site stormwater use, interception, evapotranspiration and infiltration through nonstructural controls, such as Low Impact Development (LID) practices and conservation design measures. Stormwater volume that cannot be addressed using nonstructural practices is required to be captured in structural practices and be approved by the enforcing agency.

Refer to the current applicable permits on the State Water Resources Control Board website at: www.waterboards.ca.gov/constructionstormwater. Consideration to the stormwater runoff management measures should be given during the initial design process for appropriate integration into site development.
