2.For purposes of this table air-cooled condenser performance is defined as the heat rejected from the refrigerant divided by the fan nameplate rated motor power.

3.Open cooling towers shall be tested using the test procedures in CTI ATC-105. Performance of factory assembled open cooling towers shall be either certified as base models as specified in CTI STD-201 or verified by testing in the field by a CTI approved testing agency. Open factory assembled cooling towers with custom options added to a CTI certified base model for the purpose of safe maintenance or to reduce environmental or noise impact shall be rated at 90 percent of the CTI certified performance of the associated base model or at the manufacturer’s stated performance, whichever is less. Base models of open factory assembled cooling towers are open cooling towers configured in exact accordance with the Data of Record submitted to CTI as specified by CTI STD-201. There are no certification requirements for field erected cooling towers.

4.The efficiencies for open cooling towers listed in Table A5.207.1-G are not applicable for closed-circuit cooling towers.
