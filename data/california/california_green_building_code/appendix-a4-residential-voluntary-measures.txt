PREFACE

Given that land use and planning are largely regulated locally, cities, counties, and cities and counties should consider reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with development through local land-use practices in conjunction with enforcing the provisions of this code. Specific land use strategies a city, county, or city and county may wish to consider include but are not limited to the following:

Site selection. Develop sites for buildings, hardscape, roads or parking areas consistent with the local general plan and regional transportation plan pursuant to SB 375 (Stats 2008, Ch. 728).

Regional sustainable communities strategy. Site selection and building design and use shall conform the project with the prevailing regional sustainable communities strategy or alternative planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the California Air Resources Board pursuant to SB 375 (Stats. 2008, Ch. 728), including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities.

Transit priority projects. To qualify as a transit priority project, the project shall meet three criteria:

(1)(a) contain at least 50 percent residential use, based on total building square footage and, if the project contains between 26 and 50 percent nonresidential uses, a floor area ratio of not less than 0.75; (b) provide a minimum net density of at least 20 dwelling units per acre; and (c) be within one-half mile of a major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor included in a regional transportation plan as described in Section 21155 of Stats. 2008, Ch. 728;

(2)be consistent with the prevailing sustainable communities strategy or alternative planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the California Air Resources Board, including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities; and

(3)have all necessary entitlements required by the applicable local government.

Tier 1. The RCV shall not be less than 10 percent of the total material cost of the project.

Tier 2. The RCV shall not be less than 15 percent of the total material cost of the project.

For the purposes of this section, materials used as components of the structural frame shall not be used to calculate recycled content. The structural frame includes the load bearing structural elements, such as wall studs, plates, sills, columns, beams, girders, joists, rafters and trusses.

Notes:

1.Sample forms which allow user input and automatic calculation are located at http://www.hcd.ca.gov/building-standards/calgreen/calgreen-forms.html and may be used to simplify documenting compliance with this section and for calculating recycled content value of materials or assembly products.

2.Sources and recycled content of some recycled materials can be obtained from CalRecycle if not provided by the manufacturer.

A4.405.3.1.1 Total material cost.

Total material cost is the total estimated or actual cost of materials and assembly products used in the project. The required total recycled content value for the project (in dollars) shall be determined by Equation A4.4-1 or Equation A4.4-2.

Total material cost shall be calculated by using one of the methods specified below:

1.Simplified method. To obtain the total cost of the project, multiply the square footage of the residential structure by the square foot valuation established pursuant to the ICC Building Valuation Data (BVD) or other valuation data approved and/or established by the enforcing agency. The total material cost is 45 percent of the total cost of the project. Use Equations A4.4-3A or A4.4-3B to determine total material costs using the simplified method.

(Equation A4.4-3A)

(Equation A4.4-3B)
2.Detailed method. To obtain the total cost of the project, add the estimated and/or actual costs of materials used for the project, including the structure (steel, concrete, wood or masonry); the enclosure (roof, windows, doors and exterior walls); the interior walls, ceilings and finishes (gypsum board, ceiling tiles, etc.). The total estimated and/or actual costs shall not include fees, labor and installation costs, overhead, appliances, equipment, furniture or furnishings.

A4.405.3.1.2 Determination of total recycled content value (RCV).

Total RCV may be determined either by dollars or percentage as noted below.

1.Total recycled content value for the project (in dollars). This is the sum of the recycled content value of the materials and/or assemblies considered and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-4. The result of this calculation may be directly compared to Equations A4.4-1 and A4.4-2 to determine compliance with Tier 1 or Tier 2 prerequisites.

2.Total recycled content value for the project (by percentage). This is expressed as a percentage of the total material cost and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-4 and Equation A4.4-5. The result of this calculation may be directly compared for compliance with Tier 1 (10 percent) or Tier 2 (15 percent) prerequisites.

A4.405.3.1.3 Determination of recycled content value of materials (RCVM).

The recycled content value of each material (RCVM) is calculated by multiplying the cost of material, as defined by the recycled content. See Equations A4.4-6 and A4.4-7.

Notes:

1.If the postconsumer and preconsumer recycled content is provided in pounds, Equation A4.4-7 may be used, but the final result (in pounds) must be multiplied by 100 to show RCM as a percentage.

2.If the manufacturer reports total recycled content of a material as one percentage in lieu of separately reporting preconsumer and post-consumer values, the total shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.

A4.405.3.1.4 Determination of recycled content value of assemblies – (RCVA).

Recycled content value of assemblies is calculated by multiplying the total cost of the assembly by the total recycled content of the assembly (RCA), and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-8.

If not provided by the manufacturer, Total RCA (percent) is the sum (Σ) of the Proportional Recycled Content (PRCM) of each material in the assembly. RCA shall be determined by Equation A4.4-9.

PRCM of each material may be calculated by one of two methods using the following formulas:

Method 1: Recycled content (postconsumer and preconsumer) of each material provided in percentages

Method 2: Recycled content (postconsumer and preconsumer) provided in pounds

Note: If the manufacturer reports total recycled content of a material as one percentage in lieu of separately reporting preconsumer and postconsumer values, the total shall be considered preconsumer recycled material.

A4.405.3.1.5 Alternate method for concrete.

When Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), such as fly ash or ground blast furnace slag cement, are used in concrete, an alternate method of calculating and reporting recycled content in concrete products shall be permitted. When determining the recycled content value, the percent recycled content shall be multiplied by the cost of the cementitious materials only, not the total cost of the concrete.

A4.405.4 Use of building materials from rapidly renewable sources.

One or more of the following materials manufactured from rapidly renewable sources or agricultural byproducts is used:

1.Insulation.

2.Bamboo or cork.

3.Engineered products.

4.Agricultural based products.

5.Other products acceptable to the enforcing agency.
