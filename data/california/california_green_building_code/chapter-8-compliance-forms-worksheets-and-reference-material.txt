Construction Waste Management (CWM) Plan

Note: This sample form may be used to assist in documenting compliance with the waste management plan.

Project Name: ___________________________________________________

Job #: __________________________________________________________

Project Manager: _________________________________________________

Waste Hauling Company: __________________________________________

Contact Name: ______________________________________________

All Subcontractors shall comply with the project’s Construction Waste Management Plan.

All Subcontractor foremen shall sign the CWM Plan Acknowledgment Sheet.

Subcontractors who fail to comply with the Waste Management Plan will be subject to backcharges or withholding of payment, as deemed appropriate. For instance, Subcontractors who contaminate debris boxes that have been designated for a single material type will be subject to backcharge or withheld payment, as deemed appropriate.

1.The project’s overall rate of waste diversion will be ____ %.

2.This project shall generate the least amount of waste possible by planning and ordering carefully, following all proper storage and handling procedures to reduce broken and damaged materials and reusing materials whenever possible. The majority of the waste that is generated on this jobsite will be diverted from the landfill and recycled for other use.

3.Spreadsheet 1, enclosed, identifies the waste materials that will be generated on this project, the diversion strategy for each waste type and the anticipated diversion rate.

4.Waste prevention and recycling activities will be discussed at the beginning of weekly subcontractor meetings. As each new subcontractor comes on-site, the WMP Coordinator will present him/her with a copy of the CWM Plan and provide a tour of the jobsite to identify materials to be salvaged and the procedures for handling jobsite debris. All Subcontractor foremen will acknowledge in writing that they have read and will abide by the CWM Plan. Subcontractor Acknowledgment Sheet enclosed. The CWM Plan will be posted at the jobsite trailer.

5.Salvage: Excess materials that cannot be used in the project, nor returned to the vendor, will be offered to site workers, the owner or donated to charity if feasible.

6.[HAULING COMPANY] will provide a commingled drop box at the jobsite for most of the construction waste. These commingled drop boxes will be taken to [Sorting Facility Name and Location]. The average diversion rate for commingled waste will be ____%. As site conditions permit, additional drop boxes will be used for particular phases of construction (e.g., concrete and wood waste) to ensure the highest waste diversion rate possible.

7.In the event that the waste diversion rate achievable via the strategy described in (6) above, is projected to be lower than what is required, then a strategy of source-separated waste diversion and/or waste stream reduction will be implemented. Source separated waste refers to jobsite waste that is not commingled but is instead allocated to a debris box designated for a single material type, such as clean wood or metal.

Notes:

1.Waste stream reduction refers to efforts taken by the builder to reduce the amount of waste generated by the project to below four (4) pounds per square foot of building area.

2.When using waste stream reduction measures, the gross weight of the product is subtracted from a base weight of four (4) pounds per square foot of building area. This reduction is considered additional diversion and can be used in the waste reduction percentage calculations.

8.[HAULING COMPANY] will track and calculate the quantity (in tons) of all waste leaving the project and calculate the waste diversion rate for the project. [HAULING COMPANY] will provide Project Manager with an updated monthly report on gross weight hauled and the waste diversion rate being achieved on the project. [HAULING COMPANY’s] monthly report will track separately the gross weights and diversion rates for commingled debris and for each source-separated waste stream leaving the project. In the event that [HAULING COMPANY] does not service any or all of the debris boxes on the project, the [HAULING COMPANY] will work with the responsible parties to track the material type and weight (in tons) in such debris boxes in order to determine waste diversion rates for these materials.

9.In the event that Subcontractors furnish their own debris boxes as part of their scope of work, such Subcontractors shall not be excluded from complying with the CWM Plan and will provide [HAULING COMPANY] weight and waste diversion data for their debris boxes.

10.In the event that site use constraints (such as limited space) restrict the number of debris boxes that can be used for collection of designated waste the project Superintendent will, as deemed appropriate, allocate specific areas onsite where individual material types are to be consolidated. These collection points are not to be contaminated with non-designated waste types.

11.Debris from jobsite office and meeting rooms will be collected by [DISPOSAL SERVICE COMPANY]. [DISPOSAL SERVICE COMPANY] will, at a minimum, recycle office paper, plastic, metal and cardboard.

Commissioning Referenced Standards for Non-Energy Systems

The following CALGreen Referenced Standards are included herein as a convenience for the users of the California Green Building Standards Code, but they are not considered to be part of the code unless they are officially adopted by a local jurisdiction.

Contents		Page
Part 1:	Standards for Compliance with Building Commissioning	64.2
Part 2:	Commissioning Sample Forms and Templates	64.12Part 1 STANDARDS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING COMMISSIONING

Reference: Section 5.410.2, Commissioning.

Introduction:

The purpose of this code is to improve public health, safety and general welfare by enhancing the design and construction of buildings through the use of concepts that reduce negative and increase positive environmental impacts. Commissioning is a vital element in this effort.

Definitions used in the CALGreen Cx Reference standard: CALGreen

Acronyms	
BOD	Basis of Design
Cx	Commissioning
FPT	Functional Performance Test
HVAC	Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning
O&M	Operations and Maintenance
OPR	Owner’s Project RequirementsGlossary:

Acceptance Criteria—The conditions that must be met for systems or equipment to meet defined and expected outcomes.

Commissioning (Cx)—Building commissioning as required in this code involves a quality assurance process that begins during design and continues to occupancy. Commissioning verifies that the new building operates as the owner intended and that building staff are prepared to operate and maintain its systems and equipment. Exceptions are allowed for dry storage warehouses of any size and conditioned spaces under 10,000 square feet accessory to them; and for tenant improvements under 10,000 square feet within a larger space.

Owner—The individual or entity holding title to the property on which the building is constructed.

Commissioning Coordinator—The person who coordinates the commissioning process. This can be either a third-party commissioning provider or an experienced member of the design team or owner in-house staff member.

Commissioning Team—The key members of each party involved with the project designated to provide insight and carry out tasks necessary for a successful commissioning project. Team members may include the commissioning coordinator, owner or owner’s representative, building staff, design professionals, contractors or manufacturer’s representatives and testing specialists.

Independent Third-Party Commissioning Professional—A commissioning consultant contracted directly by the owner who is not responsible to, or affiliated with, any other member of the design and construction team.

Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manuals—Documents that provide information necessary for operating and maintaining installed equipment and systems.

Owner Representative—An individual or entity assigned by the owner to act and sign on the owner’s behalf.

Process Equipment—Energy-using equipment and components that are not used for HVAC, electrical, plumbing and irrigation operations. Such devices would include but are not limited to heat transfer, water purifying, air cleaning, air vacuum and air compressing.

Sequence of Operation—A written description of the intended performance and operation of each control element and feature of the equipment and systems.

Selecting Trained Personnel (for Commissioning)

This code requires that “Commissioning shall be performed in accordance with this section by trained personnel with experience on projects of comparable size and complexity.” The trained personnel manage and facilitate the commissioning process. The trained personnel develop and implement the commissioning tasks and documentation identified in Sections 5.410.2.1 through 5.410.2.6. Trained personnel may include appropriate members of owner staff, contractor and design team as well as independent commissioning professionals.

It is essential that there is a single person designated to lead and manage the commissioning activities. In practice, this individual has been referenced by various identifiers such as commissioning authority, agent, provider, coordinator, lead, etc. In this guide the term “commissioning coordinator” is used.

The designated commissioning coordinator may be an independent, third-party commissioning professional, a project design team member (e.g., engineer or architect), an owner’s engineer or facility staff, contractor or specialty subcontractor. Methods of evaluating the designated commissioning coordinator and trained personnel include review of the following:

1.Technical knowledge;

2.Relevant experience;

3.Potential conflict of interest concerns;

4.Professional certifications and training;

5.Communication and organizational skills; and

6.Reference and sample work products.

Selection of “trained,” qualified personnel is required by this code. In order to meet this requirement, the commissioning provider should be evaluated via the methods discussed above. In addition, various organizations have training and certification programs that may be a source for identification of qualified commissioning providers.

For information about enforcement and compliance of each commissioning element see Sections 5.410.2.1 through 5.410.2.6.

For compliance forms and templates see Part 2 following this standard.

Reference: 1 Owner’s Project Requirements

CALGreen Section 5.410.2.1, CALGreen Owner’s or Owner representative’s Project Requirements (OPR).

1.1 Intent:

The Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR) documents the functional requirements of a project and expectations of the building use and operation as it relates to systems being commissioned. The document describes the physical and functional building characteristics desired by the owner and establishes performance and acceptance criteria. The OPR is most effective when developed during predesign and used to develop the Basis of Design (BOD) during the design process. The level of detail and complexity of the OPR will vary according to building use, type and systems.

1.2 Compliance Method:

Compliance is demonstrated by the owner or owner’s representative developing and/or approving the Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR) document and can be defined as follows:
