CHAPTER 8-9 MECHANICAL, PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS

SECTION 8-901 PURPOSE, INTENT AND SCOPE

8-901.1 Purpose.

The purpose of the CHBC is to provide regulations for the mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems of buildings designated as qualified historical buildings or properties. The CHBC requires enforcing agencies to accept any reasonable equivalent solutions to the regular code when dealing with qualified historical buildings or properties.

8-901.2 Intent.

The intent of the CHBC is to preserve the integrity of qualified historical buildings or properties while providing a reasonable level of protection from fire, health and life-safety hazards (hereinafter referred to as safety hazards) for the building occupants.

8-901.3 Scope.

The CHBC shall be applied in conjunction with the regular code whenever compliance with the regular code is required for qualified historical buildings or properties.

8-901.4 Safety hazard.

No person shall permit any safety hazard to exist on premises under their control, or fail to take immediate action to abate such hazard. Existing systems which constitute a safety hazard when operational may remain in place, provided they are completely and permanently rendered inoperative. Safety hazards created by inoperative systems shall not be permitted to exist. Requirements of the regular code concerning general regulations shall be complied with, except that the enforcing agency shall accept solutions which do not cause a safety hazard.

8-901.5 Energy conservation.

Qualified historical buildings or properties covered by this part are exempted from compliance with energy conservation standards. When new nonhistorical lighting and space conditioning system components, devices, appliances and equipment are installed, they shall comply with the requirements of Title 24, Part 6, The California Energy Code, except where the historical significance or character-defining features are threatened.

Ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protected receptacles shall be installed where replacements are made at receptacle outlets that are required to be so protected by the regular code in effect at the time of replacement. Metallic face plates shall either be grounded to the grounded metal outlet box or be grounded to the grounding-type device when used with devices supplied by branch circuits without equipment grounding conductors.

8-904.2.3

Grounding-type receptacles shall not be used without a grounding means in an existing receptacle outlet unless GFCI protected. Existing nongrounding receptacles shall be permitted to be replaced with nongrounding or grounding-type receptacles where supplied through a ground fault circuit interrupter.

8-904.2.4

Extensions of existing branch circuits without equipment-grounding conductors shall be permitted to supply grounding-type devices only when the equipment grounding conductor of the new extension is grounded to any accessible point on the grounding electrode system.

8-904.2.5

Receptacle outlet spacing and other related distance requirements shall be waived or modified if determined to be impracticable by the enforcing agency.

8-904.2.6

For the replacement of lighting fixtures on an existing nongrounded lighting outlet, or when extending an existing nongrounding lighting outlet, the following shall apply:

1.The exposed conductive parts of lighting fixtures shall be connected to any acceptable point on the grounding electrode system, or

2.The lighting fixtures shall be made of insulating material and shall have no exposed conductive parts.

Exception: Lighting fixtures mounted on electrically nonconductive ceilings or walls where located not less than either 8 feet (2438 mm) vertically or 5 feet (1524 mm) horizontally from grounded surfaces.

8-904.2.7

Lighting load calculations for services and feeders may be based on actual loads as installed in lieu of the “watts per square foot” method.

8-904.2.8

Determination of existing loads may be based on maximum demand recordings in lieu of calculations, provided all of the following are met:

1.Recordings are provided by the serving agency.

2.The maximum demand data is available for a one-year period.

Exception: If maximum demand data for a one-year period is not available, the maximum demand data shall be permitted to be based on the actual amperes continuously recorded over a minimum 30-day period by a recording ammeter connected to the highest loaded phase of the feeder or service. The recording should reflect the maximum demand when the building or space is occupied and include the measured or calculated load at the peak time of the year, including the larger of the heating or cooling equipment load.

3.There has been no change in occupancy or character of load during the previous 12 months.

4.The anticipated load will not change, or the existing demand load at 125 percent plus the new load does not exceed the ampacity of the feeder or rating of the service.
