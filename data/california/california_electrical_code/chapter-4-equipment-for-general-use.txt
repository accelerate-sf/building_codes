Notes:All types listed in Table 400.4 shall have individual conductors twisted together, except for Types HPN, SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3, SPT-1, SPT-2, SPT-3, SPT-1W, SPT-2W, TPT, NISP-1, NISP-2, NISPT-1, NISPT-2, NISPE-1, NISPE-2, and three-conductor parallel versions of SRD, SRDE, and SRDT.
The individual conductors of all cords, except those of heat-resistant cords, shall have a thermoset or thermoplastic insulation, except that the equipment grounding conductor, where used, shall be in accordance with 400.23(B).
1Rubber-filled or varnished cambric tapes shall be permitted as a substitute for the inner braids.
2Elevator traveling cables for operating control and signal circuits shall contain nonmetallic fillers as necessary to maintain concentricity. Cables shall have steel supporting members as required for suspension by 620.41. In locations subject to excessive moisture or corrosive vapors or gases, supporting members of other materials shall be permitted. Where steel supporting members are used, they shall run straight through the center of the cable assembly and shall not be cabled with the copper strands of any conductor.
In addition to conductors used for control and signaling circuits, Types E, EO, ETP, and ETT elevator cables shall be permitted to incorporate in the construction one or more 20 AWG telephone conductor pairs, one or more coaxial cables, or one or more optical fibers. The 20 AWG conductor pairs shall be permitted to be covered with suitable shielding for telephone, audio, or higher frequency communications circuits; the coaxial cables shall consist of a center conductor, insulation, and a shield for use in video or other radio frequency communications circuits. The optical fiber shall be suitably covered with flame-retardant thermoplastic. The insulation of the conductors shall be rubber or thermoplastic of a thickness not less than specified for the other conductors of the particular type of cable. Metallic shields shall have their own protective covering. Where used, these components shall be permitted to be incorporated in any layer of the cable assembly but shall not run straight through the center.
3Insulations and outer coverings that meet the requirements as flame retardant, limited smoke, and are so listed, shall be permitted to be marked for limited smoke after the Code type designation.
4Elevator cables in sizes 20 AWG through 14 AWG are rated 300 volts, and sizes 10 AWG through 2 AWG are rated 600 volts. 12 AWG is rated 300 volts with a 0.76 mm (30 mil) insulation thickness and 600 volts with a 1.14 mm (45 mil) insulation thickness.
5Conductor size for Types EV, EVJ, EVE, EVJE, EVT, and EVJT cables apply to nonpower-limited circuits only. Conductors of power-limited (data, signal, or communications) circuits may extend beyond the stated AWG size range. All conductors shall be insulated for the same cable voltage rating.
6Insulation thickness for Types EV, EVJ, EVEJE, EVT, and EVJT cables of nylon construction is indicated in parentheses.
7Types G, G-GC, S, SC, SCE, SCT, SE, SEO, SEOO, SEW, SEOW, SEOOW, SO, SOO, SOW, SOOW, ST, STO, STOO, STW, STOW, STOOW, PPE, and W shall be permitted for use on theater stages, in garages, and elsewhere where flexible cords are permitted by this Code.
8The third conductor in Type HPN shall be used as an equipment grounding conductor only. The insulation of the equipment grounding conductor for Types SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3, SPT-1, SPT-2, SPT-3, NISPT-1, NISPT-2, NISPE-1, and NISPE-2 shall be permitted to be thermoset polymer.
9Cords that comply with the requirements for outdoor cords and are so listed shall be permitted to be designated as weather and water resistant with the suffix "W" after the Code type designation. Cords with the "W" suffix are suitable for use in wet locations and are sunlight resistant.
10The required outer covering on some single-conductor cables may be integral with the insulation.
11Types TPT and TST shall be permitted in lengths not exceeding 2.5 m (8 ft) where attached directly, or by means ofa special type of plug, to a portable appliance rated at 50 watts or less and of such nature that extreme flexibility of the cord is essential.

Notes:
1. Where the required fuse rating or circuit breaker setting does not correspond to a standard rating or setting, a higher rating or setting that does not exceed the following shall be permitted:
a. The next higher standard rating or setting for fuses and circuit breakers 1000 volts and below, or
b. The next higher commercially available rating or setting for fuses and circuit breakers above 1000 volts.
2. Where secondary overcurrent protection is required, the secondary overcurrent device shall be permitted to consist of not more than six circuit breakers or six sets of fuses grouped in one location. Where multiple overcurrent devices are utilized, the total of all the device ratings shall not exceed the allowed value of a single overcurrent device. If both circuit breakers and fuses are used as the overcurrent device, the total of the device ratings shall not exceed that allowed for fuses.
3. A supervised location is a location where conditions of maintenance and supervision ensure that only qualified persons monitor and service the transformer installation.
4. Electronically actuated fuses that may be set to open at a specific current shall be set in accordance with settings for circuit breakers.
5. A transformer equipped with a coordinated thermal overload protection by the manufacturer shall be permitted to have separate secondary protection omitted.

Notes:
1. Where 125 percent of this current does not correspond to a standard rating of a fuse or nonadjustable circuit breaker, a higher rating that does not exceed the next higher standard rating shall be permitted.
2. Where secondary overcurrent protection is required, the secondary overcurrent device shall be permitted to consist of not more than six circuit breakers or six sets of fuses grouped in one location. Where multiple overcurrent devices are utilized, the total of all the device ratings shall not exceed the allowed value of a single overcurrent device.
3. A transformer equipped with coordinated thermal overload protection by the manufacturer and arranged to interrupt the primary current shall be permitted to have primary overcurrent protection rated or set at a current value that is not more than six times the rated current of the transformer for transformers having not more than 6 percent impedance and not more than four times the rated current of the transformer for transformers having more than 6 percent but not more than 10 percent impedance.
