Note 1: For bundle sizes over 192 cables, or for conductor sizes smaller than 26 AWG, ampacities shall be permitted to be determined by qualified personnel under engineering supervision.
Note 2: Where only half of the conductors in each cable are carrying current, the values in the table shall be permitted to be increased by a factor of 1.4.
Informational Note No. 1: Elevated cable temperatures can reduce a cable's data transmission performance. For information on practices for 4-pair balanced twisted pair cabling, see TIA-TSB-184-A and 6.4.7, 6.6.3, and Annex G of ANSI/TIA-568-C.2, which provide guidance on adjustments for operating temperatures between 20°C and 60°C.
Informational Note No. 2: The per-contact current rating of connectors can limit the maximum allowable current below the ampacity shown in Table 725.144.
