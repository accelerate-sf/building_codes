1 Vmax, Imax, and VAmax are determined with the current-limiting impedance in the circuit (not bypassed) as follows:
Vmax — Maximum system voltage regardless of load with rated input applied.
Imax — Maximum system current under any noncapacitive load, including short circuit, and with overcurrent protection bypassed if used. Imax limits apply after 1 minute of operation.
VAmax — Maximum volt-ampere output after 1 minute of operation regardless of load and overcurrent protection bypassed if used.
2 Overcurrent protection is not required where the current-limiting device provides equivalent current limitation and the current-limiting device does not reset until power or the load is removed.
