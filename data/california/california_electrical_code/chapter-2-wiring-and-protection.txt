Notes:1. Over 12 kW through 27 kW ranges all of same rating. For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.
2. Over 83/4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 83/4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.
3. Over 13/4 kW through 83/4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 13/4 kW but not more than 83/4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.
4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.
5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 13/4 kW and used in instructional programs.

(A) Feeder and Branch-Circuit Conductors
(B) Feeder Taps
Tap conductors are considered to be protected under short-circuit conditions when their short-circuit temperature limit is not exceeded. Conductor heating under short-circuit conditions is determined by (1) or (2):
(1) Short-Circuit Formula for Copper Conductors
(I2/A2)t = 0.0297 log10 [(T2 + 234)/(T1 + 234)]
(2) Short-Circuit Formula for Aluminum Conductors
(I2/A2)t = 0.0125 log10 [(T2 + 228)/(T1 + 228)]
where:
I = short-circuit current in amperes
A = conductor area in circular mils
t = time of short circuit in seconds (for times less than or equal to 10 seconds)
T1 = initial conductor temperature in degrees Celsius
T2 = final conductor temperature in degrees Celsius
Copper conductor with paper, rubber, varnished cloth insulation, T2 = 200
Copper conductor with thermoplastic insulation, T2 = 150
Copper conductor with cross-linked polyethylene insulation, T2 = 250
Copper conductor with ethylene propylene rubber insulation, T2 = 250
Aluminum conductor with paper, rubber, varnished cloth insulation, T2 = 200
Aluminum conductor with thermoplastic insulation, T2 = 150
Aluminum conductor with cross-linked polyethylene insulation, T2 = 250

Notes:1. If the ungrounded supply conductors are larger than 1100 kcmil copper or 1750 kcmil aluminum, the grounded conductor or bonding jumper shall have an area not less than 121/2 percent of the area of the largest ungrounded supply conductor or equivalent area for parallel supply conductors. The grounded conductor or bonding jumper shall not be required to be larger than the largest ungrounded conductor or set of ungrounded conductors.
2. If the ungrounded supply conductors are larger than 1100 kcmil copper or 1750 kcmil aluminum and if the ungrounded supply conductors and the bonding jumper are of different materials (copper, aluminum, or copper-clad aluminum), the minimum size of the grounded conductor or bonding jumper shall be based on the assumed use of ungrounded supply conductors of the same material as the grounded conductor or bonding jumper and will have an ampacity equivalent to that of the installed ungrounded supply conductors.
3. If multiple sets of service-entrance conductors are used as permitted in 230.40, Exception No. 2, or if multiple sets of ungrounded supply conductors are installed for a separately derived system, the equivalent size of the largest ungrounded supply conductor(s) shall be determined by the largest sum of the areas of the corresponding conductors of each set.
4. If there are no service-entrance conductors, the supply conductor size shall be determined by the equivalent size of the largest service-entrance conductor required for the load to be served.
