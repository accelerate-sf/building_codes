If the number of current-carrying conductors in a cord or cable exceeds three and the load diversity is 50 percent or less, the ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced as shown in the following table:

(3) Identification of Conductors in Multiconductor Extra-Hard-Usage Cords and Cables
Number of Conductors	Percent of Ampacity Value in Table 520.44(C)(3)
4—6	80
7—24	70
25—42	60
43 and above	50
Note: Ultimate insulation temperature. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way with respect to the kind of circuit, the wiring method used, or the number of conductors such that the temperature limit of the conductors is exceeded.
A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit need not be considered as a current-carrying conductor.
In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two-phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, the neutral conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral currents of the other conductors and shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.
On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, there are harmonic currents in the neutral conductor. Therefore, the neutral conductor shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.

Notes:
1. Where shore power accommodations provide two receptacles specifically for an individual boat slip and these receptacles have different voltages (for example, one 30 ampere, 125 volt and one 50 ampere, 125/250 volt), only the receptacle with the larger kilowatt demand shall be required to be calculated.
2. If the facility being installed includes individual kilowatt-hour submeters for each slip and is being calculated using the criteria listed in Table 555.6, the total demand amperes may be multiplied by 0.9 to achieve the final demand amperes.
