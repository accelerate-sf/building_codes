When the automatic activation of a smoke damper or a combination smoke-fire damper occurs, the HVAC system serving such dampers shall immediately shut down.

Exceptions:

HVAC systems that are part of an engineered smoke evacuation system.

Where the automatic activation causes all the smoke dampers and combination smoke-fire dampers to close in the enclosed space having a common atmosphere where openings are required to be protected.

Where analysis demonstrates shutoff would create a greater hazard.

The HVAC system shall not be restarted again until all the dampers are reset and fully opened.
