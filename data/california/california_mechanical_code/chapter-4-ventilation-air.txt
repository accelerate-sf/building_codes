407.4.1.7

trauma room

For operating rooms, cardiac catheterization labs, angiography rooms, cystoscopy rooms, delivery rooms, cesarean operating rooms, newborn intensive care, and nurseries provide approximately 15% excess supply air to the room or a sufficient quantity of excess supply air to maintain an appropriate positive air balance based on the room tightness and number of doors. For all rooms not listed in this footnote or not listed in Section 322.0 requiring either a positive or negative air balance, provide approximately 10% differential cfm between supply and return/exhaust airflow but not less than 25 cfm differential shall be provided regardless of room size. Room function, size, and tightness may be considered when determining the differential airflow required. Where continuous directional control is not required, variations between supply cfm and return or exhaust cfm shall be minimized in accordance with Section 407.4.1.3.

The anteroom shall have negative air pressure in relation to the protective environment room. A door louver, transfer grille, or other acceptable means may be provided to allow for airflow from the protective environment room to the anteroom. The protective environment room shall have positive-pressure in relation to the anteroom and adjoining toilet room.

The airborne infection isolation room shall have negative pressure in relation to the anteroom, and the adjoining toilet room shall have negative pressure in relation to the airborne infection isolation room.

This

is based on Table 7.1 in ASHRAE 170, "Ventilation of Healthcare Facilities", and is used with expressed written permission from

Nurse station pressure relationship and ventilation requirements shall match the area in which it is located.

The number of air changes per hour indicated is reestablished whenever the space is occupied.

The pressure relationship with the surrounding rooms is maintained when the air changes per hour are reduced. In areas requiring no continuous directional control as identified in accordance with Table 4-A, ventilation systems may be shut down when the space is unoccupied and ventilation is not otherwise required. Ventilation shall not be reduced in rooms specifically used for airborne infection control, such as waiting rooms, triage rooms, corridors, reception areas, areas adjacent to waiting areas, airborne infection isolation rooms, negative pressure exam room, negative pressure x-ray treatment rooms, and protective environment rooms. All operating and delivery rooms shall maintain a minimum of six air changes per hour of total air when not in use.
