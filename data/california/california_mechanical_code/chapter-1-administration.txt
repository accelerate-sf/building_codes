Pursuant to Health and Safety Code
Section 13108, and except as otherwise provided in
this section, building standards adopted by the State

Marshal may authorize such chief fire official and
his or her authorized representatives, in their
geographical area of responsibility, to make fire
prevention inspections of state-owned or state-occupied
buildings, other than state institutions, for the
purpose of enforcing the regulations relating to fire
and panic safety adopted by the State Fire Marshal
pursuant to this section and building standards
relating to fire and panic safety published in the
California Building Standards Code. Authorization
from the State Fire Marshal shall be limited to those
fire departments or fire districts which maintain a
fire prevention bureau staffed by paid personnel.



     Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section
13108, any requirement or order made by any chief
fire official who is authorized by the State Fire
Marshal to make fire prevention inspections of state-owned

receiving an appeal and subject to the provisions of
Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 18945) of Part

regulations adopted by the State Fire Marshal and
building standards relating to fire and panic safety
published in the California Building Code.



     Any person may request a code interpretation
from the State Fire Marshal relative to the intent of
any regulation or provision adopted by the State
Fire Marshal. When the request relates to a specific
project, occupancy or building, the State Fire

for not less than six months, or by both. A
person is guilty of a separate offense each day
during which he or she commits, continues or
permits a violation of any provision of, or any order,
rule or regulation of, the State Fire Marshal as
contained in this code.

Any fire protection district organized
pursuant to Health and Safety Code Part 2.7
(commencing with Section 13800) of Division 12 may
adopt building standards relating to fire and panic
safety that are more stringent than those building
standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and
contained in the California Building Standards Code.
For these purposes, the district board shall be deemed
a legislative body and the district shall be deemed a
local agency. Any changes or modifications that are
more stringent than the requirements published in the
California Building Standards Code relating to fire
and panic safety shall be subject to Section 1.1.8.1.

1.11.2.3.2
Any fire protection district that proposes to
adopt an ordinance pursuant to this section shall, not

city, county, or city and county may provide the district
with written comments, which shall become part of the
fire protection districts public hearing record.

the adopted ordinance to the city, county, or city and
county where the ordinance will apply. The legislative
body of the city, county, or city and county may

days of the determination. Any modification or denial
of an adopted ordinance shall include a written statement
describing the reasons for any modifications or denial. No ordinance adopted by the district shall be

of an adopted ordinance, the city, county, or
city and county shall file a copy of the findings of the
district, and any findings of the city, county, or city

shall be made in writing to the enforcing agency by
the owner or the owner's authorized representative and

Sufficient evidence or proof shall be submitted to substantiate
any claim that may be made regarding its conformance.
The enforcing agency may require tests and the
submission of a test report from an approved testing
organization as set forth in Title 19, California Code of
Regulation, to substantiate the equivalency of the
proposed alternative means of protection.

involves hazardous materials, the authority having jurisdiction
may consider implementation of the findings and
recommendations identified in a Risk Management Plan
(RMP) developed in accordance with Title 19, Division 2,
Chapter 4.5, Article 3.



     Approval of a request for use of an alternative material,
assembly of materials, equipment, method of
construction, method of installation of equipment, or
means of protection made pursuant to these provisions
shall be limited to the particular case covered by request
and shall not be construed as establishing any precedent
for any future request.

1.11.2.5 Appeals
Appeals

When a request for an alternate means
of protection has been denied by the enforcing agency, the
applicant may file a written appeal to the State Fire
Marshal for consideration of the applicant's proposal. In
considering such appeal, the State Fire Marshal may seek
the advice of the State Board of Fire Services. The State
Fire Marshal shall, after considering all of the facts
presented, including any recommendations of the State
Board of Fire Services, determine if the proposal is for the
purposes intended, at least equivalent to that specified in
these regulations in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire
resistance, durability and safety, and shall transmit such
