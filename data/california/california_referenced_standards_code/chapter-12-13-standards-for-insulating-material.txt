QUALITY STANDARDS

Sec. 12-13-1553.

The manufacturer shall cause the testing of samples of insulating material for conformity with the quality standards described in this section.

(a)General testing provisions. In testing any material pursuant to this section, the following general procedures shall be used.

1.All tests with the exception of the ANSI/ASTM E84-79 test shall be conducted using representative samples at the representative thickness of the insulation, except that when the final use of an insulating material entails a thickness less than the representative thickness, then the insulating material will be tested at the lesser thickness.

2.Where uniformity of product ensures consistency of test results across a product grouping, test results for one may be used for certification of other products within that product group. The manufacturer shall provide sufficient documentation to establish a valid basis for applying a particular test result to other products within the group.

The Executive Director shall determine whether a valid basis exists for grouping products for testing pursuant to this subsection. If it is determined that a valid basis does not exist, individual tests shall be required. A manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director’s determination to the full Commission.

3.Thermal performance of building insulations shall be stated in R value. Other insulations shall use thermal conductivity, conductance or R value as appropriate.

4.All thermal performance tests shall be conducted on materials which have been conditioned at 73.4° ± 3.6°F and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 percent for 24 hours immediately preceding the tests. The average testing temperature shall be 75° ± 2°F with at least a 40°F (4°C) temperature difference.

5.Aluminum foil insulation shall be tested according to ANSI/ASTM C236-66 to determine the thermal performance in horizontal, upward and downward directions. The tested thermal performance in the heat-flow direction or directions of the intended application shall be labeled on the material. The manufacturer shall test once in each direction of intended application, except that for products labeled with only one heat-flow direction, the manufacturer shall test two samples in that direction.

6.Insulation (other than aluminum foil insulation materials) for which additional value is claimed for facings and air spaces shall be tested for thermal performance as a material without the air space pursuant to this article. The manufacturer may elect to report additional thermal performance values of a given construction tested according to ANSI/ASTM C236-66 for that construction as long as full details of that construction are also disclosed in the certification statement and pursuant to Section 1557 (c) of this article. If a manufacturer elects to report a thermal performance value for a material plus an air space (as supplemental information to the required material thermal performance), but not necessarily for a full construction, the manufacturer must also disclose the conditions of the test and the limitations to the attainment of that result.

7.Except as provided in Items 5 and 6, the thermal performance test results certified under Section 1555 of this article shall be the average of the values obtained from at least three tests.

8.The average measured thermal performance of the tests required by Items 5, 6 and 7 shall not be more than 5 percent below the value specified on the product. In addition, all insulation material sold within the state after September 22, 1981, shall have a measured thermal performance not more than 10 percent below the value specified on the product.

12.Manufacturers of loose fill insulations for which no settled density test is required by this section shall be required to include the installed design density in the identifying information described in Section 1557. The manufacturer shall provide sufficient documentation to establish a valid basis for the determination of installed design density.

The Executive Director shall determine whether a valid basis exists for the installed design density claimed by the manufacturer. If it is determined that a valid basis does not exist, the director may assign an appropriate installed design density or may require an appropriate test to determine the installed design density. The manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director’s determination to the full Commission.

13.Within 180 days after the availability of appropriate representative thickness calibration samples from the National Bureau of Standards, all insulating materials thicker than 1 inch (25 mm), which have not previously been tested at the representative thickness of a representative sample, shall be tested at representative thickness and recertified. Test results and a revised certification statement will be submitted to the Executive Director. The Executive Director shall determine if and when an appropriate representative thickness calibration sample is available from the National Bureau of Standards and shall publish a list of available representative thickness calibration samples. The manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director’s determination to the full Commission.

14.All products which may be used for pressure fill retrofit wall application shall be separately tested for thermal performance using a sample prepared at the manufacturer’s recommended wall density for such applications.
