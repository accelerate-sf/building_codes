CHAPTER 3 BUILDING PLANNING

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 3 contains a wide array of building planning requirements that are critical to designing a safe and usable building. This includes, but is not limited to, requirements related to general structural design, fire-resistant construction, light, ventilation, sanitation, plumbing fixture clearances, minimum room area and ceiling height, safety glazing, means of egress, automatic fire sprinkler systems, smoke and carbon monoxide alarm systems, accessibility, solar energy systems, swimming pools, spas and hot tubs.

SECTION R300 SITE DRAINAGE

R300.1 Storm water drainage and retention during construction.

Projects which disturb less than one acre of soil and are not part of a larger common plan of development which in total disturbs one acre or more, shall manage storm water drainage during construction in accordance with the California Green Building Standards Code, Chapter 4, Division 4.1.

R300.2 Grading and paving.

Construction plans shall indicate how the site grading or drainage system will manage all surface water flows to keep water from entering buildings in accordance with the California Green Building Standards Code, Chapter 4, Division 4.1.

SECTION R301 DESIGN CRITERIA

R301.1 Application.

Buildings and structures, and parts thereof, shall be constructed to safely support all loads, including dead loads, live loads, roof loads, flood loads, snow loads, wind loads and seismic loads as prescribed by this code. The construction of buildings and structures in accordance with the provisions of this code shall result in a system that provides a complete load path that meets the requirements for the transfer of loads from their point of origin through the load-resisting elements to the foundation. Buildings and structures constructed as prescribed by this code are deemed to comply with the requirements of this section.

Existing buildings housing existing protective social care homes or facilities established prior to 1972 (see Chapter 11 of the  California Fire Code and the California Existing Building Code).

R301.1.1 Alternative provisions.

As an alternative to the requirements in Section R301.1, the following standards are permitted subject to the limitations of this code and the limitations therein. Where engineered design is used in conjunction with these standards, the design shall comply with the California Building Code.

1.AWC Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM).

2.AISI Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Prescriptive Method for One- and Two-Family Dwellings (AISI S230).

3.ICC Standard on the Design and Construction of Log Structures (ICC 400).

R301.1.1.1 Alternative provisions for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings.

The purpose of this subsection is to permit alternatives that provide minimum protection of life, limb, health, property, safety and welfare of the general public and the owners and occupants of limited-density owner-built rural dwellings as defined in Chapter 2 of this code. For additional information see Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 8, of Title 25, California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 74.

To meet compliance with the requirements of this code, provisions of Section R301.1.1.1, Items 1 through 5 may be utilized for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings when the materials, methods of construction or appliances are determined appropriate or suitable for their intended purpose by the local enforcing agency.

1.A limited-density owner-built rural dwelling may be of any type of construction which will provide for a sound structural condition. Structural hazards which result in an unsound condition and which may constitute a substandard building are delineated in Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code.

2.There shall be no requirements for room dimensions as required in Chapter 3, provided there is adequate light and ventilation and means of egress.

3.There shall be no specified requirement for heating capacity or for temperature maintenance. The use of solid-fuel or solar heating devices shall be deemed as complying with the requirements of Chapter 3. If nonrenewable fuel is used in these dwellings, rooms so heated shall meet current installation standards.

4.Pier foundations, stone masonry footings and foundations, pressure-treated lumber, poles or equivalent foundation materials or designs may be used provided that bearing is sufficient.

5.Owner-produced or used materials and appliances may be utilized unless found not to be of sufficient strength or durability to perform the intended function. Owner-produced or used lumber, or shakes and shingles may be utilized unless found to contain dry rot, excessive splitting or other defects obviously rendering the material unfit in strength or durability for the intended purpose.

R301.1.2 Construction systems.

The requirements of this code are based on platform and balloon-frame construction for light-frame buildings. The requirements for concrete and masonry buildings are based on a balloon framing system. Other framing systems must have equivalent detailing to ensure force transfer, continuity and compatible deformations.

R301.1.3 Engineered design.

Where a building of otherwise conventional construction contains structural elements exceeding the limits of Section R301 or otherwise not conforming to this code, these elements shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice. The extent of such design need only demonstrate compliance of nonconventional elements with other applicable provisions and shall be compatible with the performance of the conventional framed system. Engineered design in accordance with the California Building Code is permitted for buildings and structures, and parts thereof, included in the scope of this code.

R301.1.3.1 California licensed architect or engineer.

When any portion of any structure deviates from substantial compliance with conventional framing requirements for woodframe construction found in this code, the building official shall require the construction documents to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for that irregular or non-conforming portion of work. Notwithstanding other sections of law, the law establishing these provisions is found in Business and Professions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.

R301.1.3.2 Woodframe structures greater than two-stories.

The building official shall require construction documents to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for all dwellings of woodframe construction more than two stories and basement in height. Notwithstanding other sections of law, the law establishing these provisions is found in Business and Professions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.

R301.1.3.3 Structures other than woodframe.

The building official shall require floor, wall or roof-ceiling structural elements in dwellings designed of cold-formed steel, concrete, masonry or structural insulated panels prescribed by this code to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer. Notwithstanding other sections of law, the law establishing these provisions is found in Business and Professions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.

R301.1.4 Intermodal shipping containers.

Intermodal shipping containers that are repurposed for use as buildings or structures shall be designed in accordance with the structural provisions in Section 3115 of the California Building Code.

R301.2 Climatic and geographic design criteria.

For SI: 1 mile per hour = 0.447 m/s.

a. Linear interpolation is permitted.

R301.2.1.4 Exposure category.

For each wind direction considered, an exposure category that adequately reflects the characteristics of ground surface irregularities shall be determined for the site at which the building or structure is to be constructed. For a site located in the transition zone between categories, the category resulting in the largest wind forces shall apply. Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vegetation as well as from constructed features. For a site where multiple detached one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses or other structures are to be constructed as part of a subdivision or master-planned community, or are otherwise designated as a developed area by the authority having jurisdiction, the exposure category for an individual structure shall be based on the site conditions that will exist at the time when all adjacent structures on the site have been constructed, provided that their construction is expected to begin within 1 year of the start of construction for the structure for which the exposure category is determined. For any given wind direction, the exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following categories:

1.Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger. Exposure B shall be assumed unless the site meets the definition of another type exposure.

2.Exposure C. Open terrain with scattered obstructions, including surface undulations or other irregularities, having heights generally less than 30 feet (9144 mm) extending more than 1,500 feet (457 m) from the building site in any quadrant. This exposure shall apply to any building located within Exposure B type terrain where the building is directly adjacent to open areas of Exposure C type terrain in any quadrant for a distance of more than 600 feet (183 m). This category includes flat, open country and grasslands.

3.Exposure D. Flat, unobstructed areas exposed to wind flowing over open water, smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken ice for a distance of not less than 5,000 feet (1524 m). This exposure shall apply only to those buildings and other structures exposed to the wind coming from over the unobstructed area. Exposure D extends downwind from the edge of the unobstructed area a distance of 600 feet (183 m) or 20 times the height of the building or structure, whichever is greater.

R301.2.1.5 Topographic wind effects.

In areas designated in Table R301.2 as having local historical data documenting structural damage to buildings caused by wind speed-up at isolated hills, ridges and escarpments that are abrupt changes from the general topography of the area, topographic wind effects shall be considered in the design of the building in accordance with Section R301.2.1.5.1 or in accordance with the provisions of ASCE 7. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(1) for topographic features for wind speed-up effect.

In these designated areas, topographic wind effects shall apply only to buildings sited on the top half of an isolated hill, ridge or escarpment where all of the following conditions exist:

a.Flow rate from Section R313.3.4.2.

R313.3.6.2.1 R313.3.6.2.1 Available pressure equation.

The pressure available to offset friction loss in the interior piping system (Pt) shall be determined in accordance with the Equation 29-1.

where:

Pt = Pressure used in applying Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9).

Psup = Pressure available from the water supply source.

PLsvc = Pressure loss in the water-service pipe.

PLm = Pressure loss in the water meter.

PLd = Pressure loss from devices other than the water meter.

PLe = Pressure loss associated with changes in elevation.

Psp = Maximum pressure required by a sprinkler.

R313.3.6.2.2 R313.3.6.2.2 Calculation procedure.

Determination of the required size for water distribution piping shall be in accordance with the following procedure:

Step 1 – Determine Psup

Obtain the static supply pressure that will be available from the water main from the water purveyor, or for an individual source, the available supply pressure shall be in accordance with Section R313.3.5.1.

Step 2 – Determine PLsvc

Use Table R313.3.6.2(1) to determine the pressure loss in the water service pipe based on the selected size of the water service.

Step 3 – Determine PLm

Use Table R313.3.6.2(2) to determine the pressure loss from the water meter, based on the selected water meter size.

Step 4 – Determine PLd

Determine the pressure loss from devices other than the water meter installed in the piping system supplying sprinklers, such as pressure-reducing valves, backflow preventers, water softeners or water filters. Device pressure losses shall be based on the device manufacturer’s specifications. The flow rate used to determine pressure loss shall be the rate from Section R313.3.4.2, except that 5 gpm (0.3 L/S) shall be added where the device is installed in a water-service pipe that supplies more than one dwelling. As alternative to deducting pressure loss for a device, an automatic bypass valve shall be installed to divert flow around the device when a sprinkler activates.

Step 5 – Determine PLe

Use Table R313.3.6.2(3) to determine the pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. The elevation used in applying the table shall be the difference between the elevation where the water source pressure was measured and the elevation of the highest sprinkler.

Step 6 – Determine Psp

Determine the maximum pressure required by any individual sprinkler based on the flow rate from Section R313.3.4.1. The required pressure is provided in the sprinkler manufacturer’s published data for the specific sprinkler model based on the selected flow rate.

Step 7 – Calculate Pt

Using Equation 29-1, calculate the pressure available to offset friction loss in water-distribution piping between the service valve and the sprinklers.

Step 8 – Determine the maximum allowable pipe length

Use Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) to select a material and size for water distribution piping. The piping material and size shall be acceptable if the developed length of pipe between the service valve and the most remote sprinkler does not exceed the maximum allowable length specified by the applicable table. Interpolation of Pt between the tabular values shall be permitted.

The maximum allowable length of piping in Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) incorporates an adjustment for pipe fittings, and no additional consideration of friction losses associated with pipe fittings shall be required.

R313.3.7 R313.3.7 Instructions and signs.

An owner’s manual for the fire sprinkler system shall be provided to the owner. A sign or valve tag shall be installed at the main shutoff valve to the water distribution system stating the following: “Warning, the water system for this home supplies fire sprinklers that require certain flows and pressures to fight a fire. Devices that restrict the flow or decrease the pressure or automatically shut off the water to the fire sprinkler system, such as water softeners, filtration systems and automatic shutoff valves, shall not be added to this system without a review of the fire sprinkler system by a fire protection specialist. Do not remove this sign.”

R313.3.8 R313.3.8 Inspections.

The water distribution system shall be inspected in accordance with Sections R313.3.8.1 and R313.3.8.2.
