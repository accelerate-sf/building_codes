CHAPTER 10 CHIMNEYS AND FIREPLACES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 10 contains requirements for the construction, seismic reinforcing and anchorage of masonry chimneys and fireplaces; and establishes standards for the use and installation of factory-built chimneys, fireplaces and masonry heaters. Chimneys and fireplaces constructed of masonry rely on prescriptive requirements for the details of their construction; factory-built versions rely on the listing and labeling method of approval.

Chimneys shall be provided with crickets where the dimension parallel to the ridgeline is greater than 30 inches (762 mm) and does not intersect the ridgeline. The intersection of the cricket and the chimney shall be flashed and counterflashed in the same manner as normal roof-chimney intersections. Crickets shall be constructed in compliance with Figure R1003.20 and Table R1003.20.
