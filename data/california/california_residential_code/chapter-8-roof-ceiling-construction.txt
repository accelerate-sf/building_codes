CHAPTER 8 ROOF-CEILING CONSTRUCTION

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 8 addresses the design and construction of roof-ceiling systems. This chapter contains two roof-ceiling framing systems: wood framing and cold-formed steel framing. Allowable span tables are provided to simplify the selection of rafter and ceiling joist size for wood roof framing and cold-formed steel framing. Chapter 8 also provides requirements for the application of ceiling finishes, the proper ventilation of concealed spaces in roofs (for example, enclosed attics and rafter spaces), unvented attic assemblies and attic access.

Fire-retardant-treated wood (FRTW) is any wood product that, when impregnated with chemicals by a pressure process or other means during manufacture, shall have, when tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723, a listed flame spread index of 25 or less. In addition, the ASTM E84 or UL 723 test shall be continued for an additional 20-minute period and the flame front shall not progress more than  10.5 feet (3200 mm) beyond the center line of the burners at any time during the test.

R802.1.5.1 Pressure process.

For wood products impregnated with chemicals by a pressure process, the process shall be performed in closed vessels under pressures not less than 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) (344.7 kPa).

R802.1.5.2 Other means during manufacture.

For wood products impregnated with chemicals by other means during manufacture, the treatment shall be an integral part of the manufacturing process of the wood product. The treatment shall provide permanent protection to all surfaces of the wood product. The use of paints, coating, stains or other surface treatments is not an approved method of protection as required by this section.

R802.1.5.3 Testing.

For fire-retardant-treated wood products, the front and back faces of the wood product shall be tested in accordance with and produce the results required in Section R802.1.5.

R802.1.5.3.1 Fire testing of wood structural panels.

Wood structural panels shall be tested with a ripped or cut longitudinal gap of 1/8 inch (3.2 mm).

R802.1.5.4 Labeling.

In addition to the labels required by Section 802.1.1 for sawn lumber and Section 803.2.1 for wood structural panels, each piece of fire-retardant-treated lumber and wood structural panel shall be labeled. The label shall contain:

1.The identification mark of an approved agency in accordance with Section 1703.5 of the California Building Code.

2.Identification of the treating manufacturer.

3.The name of the fire-retardant treatment.

4.The species of wood treated.

5.Flame spread index and smoke-developed index.

6.Method of drying after treatment.

7.Conformance to applicable standards in accordance with Sections R802.1.5.5 through R802.1.5.10.

8.For FRTW exposed to weather, or a damp or wet location, the words “No increase in the listed classification when subjected to the Standard Rain Test” (ASTM D2898).

R802.1.5.5 Strength adjustments.

Design values for untreated lumber and wood structural panels as specified in Section R802.1 shall be adjusted for fire-retardant-treated wood. Adjustments to design values shall be based on an approved method of investigation that takes into consideration the effects of the anticipated temperature and humidity to which the fire-retardant-treated wood will be subjected, the type of treatment and redrying procedures.

R802.1.5.6 Wood structural panels.

The effect of treatment and the method of redrying after treatment, and exposure to high temperatures and high humidities on the flexure properties of fire-retardant-treated soft-wood plywood shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D5516. The test data developed by ASTM D5516 shall be used to develop adjustment factors, maximum loads and spans, or both for untreated plywood design values in accordance with ASTM D6305. Each manufacturer shall publish the allowable maximum loads and spans for service as floor and roof sheathing for their treatment.

R802.1.5.7 Lumber.

For each species of wood treated, the effect of the treatment and the method of redrying after treatment and exposure to high temperatures and high humidities on the allowable design properties of fire-retardant-treated lumber shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D5664.

Check sources for availability of lumber in lengths greater than 20 feet.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.

a.The tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward push of the rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter spans shall be multiplied by the adjustment factors in Table R802.4.1(9).

a.HC = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls; HR = Height of roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.

R802.4.2 Framing details.

Rafters shall be framed opposite from each other to a ridge board, shall not be offset more than 11/2 inches (38 mm) from each other and shall be connected with a collar tie or ridge strap in accordance with Section R802.4.6 or directly opposite from each other to a gusset plate in accordance with Table R602.3(1). Rafters shall be nailed to the top wall plates in accordance with Table R602.3(1) unless the roof assembly is required to comply with the uplift requirements of Section R802.11.

R802.4.3 Hips and valleys.

Hip and valley rafters shall be not less than 2 inches (51 mm) nominal in thickness and not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. Hip and valley rafters shall be supported at the ridge by a brace to a bearing partition or be designed to carry and distribute the specific load at that point.

R802.4.4 Rafter supports.

Where the roof pitch is less than 3:12 (25-percent slope), structural members that support rafters, such as ridges, hips and valleys, shall be designed as beams, and bearing shall be provided for rafters in accordance with Section R802.6.

R802.4.5 Purlins.

Installation of purlins to reduce the span of rafters is permitted as shown in Figure R802.4.5. Purlins shall be sized not less than the required size of the rafters that they support. Purlins shall be continuous and shall be supported by 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) braces installed to bearing walls at a slope not less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal. The braces shall be spaced not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center and the unbraced length of braces shall not exceed 8 feet (2438 mm).

For SI: 1 degree = 0.018 rad.

HC = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of rafter support walls.

HR = Height of roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.
