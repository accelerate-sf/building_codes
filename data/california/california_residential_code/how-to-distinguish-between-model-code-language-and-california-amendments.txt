How to Distinguish Between Model Code Language and California Amendments

To distinguish between model code language and the incorporated California amendments, including exclusive California standards, California amendments will appear in italics.

[BSC] This is an example of a state agency acronym used to identify an adoption or amendment by the agency. The acronyms will appear at California Amendments and in the Matrix Adoption Tables. Sections 1.2 through 1.14 in Chapter 1, Division 1 of this code, explain the used acronyms, the application of state agency adoptions to building occupancies or building features, the enforcement agency as designated by state law (may be the state adopting agency or local building or fire official), the authority in state law for the state agency to make the adoption, and the specific state law being implemented by the agencyâ€™s adoption. The following acronyms are used in Title 24 to identify the state adopting agency making an adoption.
