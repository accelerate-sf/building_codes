In each code development cycle, proposed changes to this code are considered at the Committee Action Hearings by the applicable International Code Development Committee as follows:

[RB]	=	IRC—Building Code Development Committee
[RE]	=	International Residential Energy Conservation Code Development Committee;
[MP]	=	IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee

The [RE] committee is also responsible for the IECC—Residential Provisions.

For the development of the 2024 edition of the I-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years, as shown in the following Code Development Hearings Table.

Code change proposals submitted for IRC Chapters 1 and 3 through 10, Appendices AE, AF, AH, AJ, AK, AL, AM, AN, AO, AQ, AR, AS, AT, AU, AV and AW, and definitions designated [RB] are heard by the IRC—Building Committee during the Group B (2022) cycle code development hearing. Code change proposals submitted for Chapter 11 are heard by the International Energy Conservation Code Development Committee during the Group B (2022) cycle code development hearing. Proposed changes to all other chapters are heard by the IRC Plumbing and Mechanical Committee during the Group A (2021) code development cycle.

It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understand which code development committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal. For further information on the code development committee responsibilities, please visit the ICC website at www.iccsafe.org/current-code-development-cycle.
