APPENDIX AK SOUND TRANSMISSION

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

See Section 1206 “Sound Transmission” of the California Building Code, Title 24, Part 2, for requirements applicable to structures in this code.

User note:

About this appendix: Sound transmission relates directly to the psychological and long-term physical well-being of building occupants. Many human activities cannot be accommodated efficiently or comfortably in various types of building spaces without proper attention to the mitigation of sound transmission from other spaces within the building, or from outside of the building. In Appendix AK, attention is specifically paid to the mitigation of sound transmission between dwelling units and other dwelling units and occupancies.

SECTION AK101 GENERAL

AK101.1 General.

Wall and floor-ceiling assemblies separating dwelling units, including those separating adjacent townhouse units, shall provide airborne sound insulation for walls, and both airborne and impact sound insulation for floor-ceiling assemblies.

SECTION AK102 AIRBORNE SOUND

AK102.1 General.

Airborne sound insulation for wall and floor-ceiling assemblies shall meet a sound transmission class (STC) rating of 45 where tested in accordance with ASTM E90 or a Normalized Noise Isolation Class (NNIC) rating of 42 where tested in accordance with ASTM E336. Penetrations or openings in construction assemblies for piping; electrical devices; recessed cabinets; bathtubs; soffits; or heating, ventilating or exhaust ducts shall be sealed, lined, insulated or otherwise treated to maintain the required ratings. Dwelling unit entrance doors, which share a common space, shall be tight fitting to the frame and sill.

AK102.1.1 Masonry.

The sound transmission class of concrete masonry and clay masonry assemblies shall be calculated in accordance with TMS 0302 or determined through testing in accordance with ASTM E90.

SECTION AK103 STRUCTURAL-BORNE SOUND

AK103.1 General.

Floor/ceiling assemblies between dwelling units, or between a dwelling unit and a public or service area within a structure, shall have an impact insulation class (IIC) rating of not less than 45 when tested in accordance with ASTM E492 or a Normalized Impact Sound Rating (NISR) of 42 where tested in accordance with ASTM E1007.
