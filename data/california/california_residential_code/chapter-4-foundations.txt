CHAPTER 4 FOUNDATIONS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 4 provides requirements for constructing footings and walls for foundations of wood, masonry, concrete and precast concrete. In addition to a foundation’s ability to support the required design loads, this chapter addresses several other factors that can affect foundation performance. These include controlling surface water and subsurface drainage, requiring soil tests where conditions warrant and evaluating proximity to slopes and minimum depth requirements. This chapter also provides requirements to minimize adverse effects of moisture, decay and pests in basements and crawl spaces.

SECTION R401 GENERAL

R401.1 Application.

The provisions of this chapter shall control the design and construction of the foundation and foundation spaces for buildings. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, the design and construction of foundations in flood hazard areas as established by Table R301.2 shall meet the provisions of Section R322. Wood foundations shall be designed and installed in accordance with AWC PWF.

Exception: The provisions of this chapter shall be permitted to be used for wood foundations only in the following situations:

1.In buildings that have not more than two floors and a roof.

2.Where interior basement and foundation walls are constructed at intervals not exceeding 50 feet (15 240 mm).

Wood foundations in Seismic Design Category D0, D1 or D2 shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.

R401.2 Requirements.

Foundation construction shall be capable of accommodating all loads in accordance with Section R301 and of transmitting the resulting loads to the supporting soil. Fill soils that support footings and foundations shall be designed, installed and tested in accordance with accepted engineering practice.

Note: See Section R301.1.1.1 for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings.

R401.3 Drainage.

Surface drainage shall be diverted to a storm sewer conveyance or other approved point of collection that does not create a hazard. Lots shall be graded to drain surface water away from foundation walls. The grade shall fall not fewer than 6 inches (152 mm) within the first 10 feet (3048 mm).

Exception: Where lot lines, walls, slopes or other physical barriers prohibit 6 inches (152 mm) of fall within 10 feet (3048 mm), drains or swales shall be constructed to ensure drainage away from the structure. Impervious surfaces within 10 feet (3048 mm) of the building foundation shall be sloped not less than 2 percent away from the building.

R401.4 Soil tests.

Where quantifiable data created by accepted soil science methodologies indicate expansive soils, compressible soils, shifting soils or other questionable soil characteristics are likely to be present, the building official shall determine whether to require a soil test to determine the soil’s characteristics at a particular location. This test shall be done by an approved agency using an approved method.

R401.4.1 Geotechnical evaluation.

In lieu of a complete geotechnical evaluation, the load-bearing values in Table R401.4.1 shall be assumed.

R401.4.1.1.1 R401.4.1.1.1 Preliminary soil report. Preliminary soil report.

Each city, county, or city and county shall enact an ordinance which requires a preliminary soil report, prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the state. The report shall be based upon adequate test borings or excavations, of every subdivision, where a tentative and final map is required pursuant to Section 66426 of the Government Code.

The preliminary soil report may be waived if the building department of the city, county or city and county, or other enforcement agency charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of Section R401.4.1.1, shall determine that, due to the knowledge such department has as to the soil qualities of the soil of the subdivision or lot, no preliminary analysis is necessary.

R401.4.1.1.2 R401.4.1.1.2 Soil investigation by lot, necessity, preparation and recommendations. Soil investigation by lot, necessity, preparation and recommendations.

If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, such ordinance shall require a soil investigation of each lot in the subdivision.

The soil investigation shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered in this state. It shall recommend corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed on the expansive soil.

R401.4.1.1.3 R401.4.1.1.3 Approval, building permit conditions, appeal. Approval, building permit conditions, appeal.

The building department of each city, county or city and county, or other enforcement agency charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this code, shall approve the soil investigation if it determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed. As a condition to the building permit, the ordinance shall require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each dwelling. Appeal from such determination shall be to the local appeals board.

R401.4.1.1.4 R401.4.1.1.4 Liability. Liability.

A city, county, or city and county or other enforcement agency charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of Section R401.4.1.1, is not liable for any injury which arises out of any act or omission of the city, county or city and county, or other enforcement agency, or a public employee or any other person under Section R401.4.1.1.1, R401.4.1.1.2 or R401.4.1.1.3.

R401.4.1.1.5 R401.4.1.1.5 Alternate procedures. Alternate procedures.

The governing body of any city, county, or city and county may enact an ordinance prescribing an alternate procedure which is equal to or more restrictive than the procedures specified in Sections R401.4.1.1.1, R401.4.1.1.2 and R401.1.1.3.

R401.4.2 Compressible or shifting soil.

Instead of a complete geotechnical evaluation, where top or subsoils are compressible or shifting, they shall be removed to a depth and width sufficient to ensure stable moisture content in each active zone and shall not be used as fill or stabilized within each active zone by chemical, dewatering or presaturation.

R403.3.1 Foundations adjoining frost-protected shallow foundations.

Foundations that adjoin frost-protected shallow foundations shall be protected from frost in accordance with Section R403.1.4.

R403.3.1.1 Attachment to unheated slab-on-ground structure.

Vertical wall insulation and horizontal insulation of frost-protected shallow foundations that adjoin a slab-on-ground foundation that does not have a monthly mean temperature maintained at not less than 64°F (18°C) shall be in accordance with Figure R403.3(3) and Table R403.3(1). Vertical wall insulation shall extend between the frost-protected shallow foundation and the adjoining slab foundation. Required horizontal insulation shall be continuous under the adjoining slab foundation and through any foundation walls adjoining the frost- protected shallow foundation. Where insulation passes through a foundation wall, it shall be either of a type complying with this section and having bearing capacity equal to or greater than the structural loads imposed by the building, or the building shall be designed and constructed using beams, lintels, cantilevers or other means of transferring building loads such that the structural loads of the building do not bear on the insulation.

R403.3.1.2 Attachment to heated structure.

Where a frost-protected shallow foundation abuts a structure that has a monthly mean temperature maintained at not less than 64°F (18°C), horizontal insulation and vertical wall insulation shall not be required between the frost-protected shallow foundation and the adjoining structure. Where the frost-protected shallow foundation abuts the heated structure, the horizontal insulation and vertical wall insulation shall extend along the adjoining foundation in accordance with Figure R403.3(4) a distance of not less than Dimension A in Table R403.3(1).

Exception: Where the frost-protected shallow foundation abuts the heated structure to form an inside corner, vertical insulation extending along the adjoining foundation is not required.

R403.3.2 Protection of horizontal insulation below ground.

Horizontal insulation placed less than 12 inches (305 mm) below the ground surface or that portion of horizontal insulation extending outward more than 24 inches (610 mm) from the foundation edge shall be protected against damage by use of a concrete slab or asphalt paving on the ground surface directly above the insulation or by cementitious board, plywood rated for below-ground use, or other approved materials placed below ground, directly above the top surface of the insulation.

R403.3.3 Drainage.

Final grade shall be sloped in accordance with Section R401.3. In other than Group I Soils, as detailed in Table R405.1, gravel or crushed stone beneath horizontal insulation below ground shall drain to daylight or into an approved sewer system.

R403.3.4 Termite protection.

The use of foam plastic in areas of “very heavy” termite infestation probability shall be in accordance with Section R318.4.
