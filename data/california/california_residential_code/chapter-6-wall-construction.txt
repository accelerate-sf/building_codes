CHAPTER 6 WALL CONSTRUCTION

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 6 contains prescriptive provisions for the design and construction of walls. The wall construction covered in Chapter 6 consists of five different types: wood framed, cold-formed steel framed, masonry, concrete and structural insulated panel (SIP). The primary concern of this chapter is the structural integrity of wall construction and transfer of all imposed loads to the supporting structure.

SECTION R601 GENERAL

R601.1 Application

The provisions of this chapter shall control the design and construction of walls and partitions for buildings.

R601.2 Requirements

Wall construction shall be capable of accommodating all loads imposed in accordance with Section R301 and of transmitting the resulting loads to the supporting structural elements.

R601.2.1 Compressible floor-covering materials

Compressible floor-covering materials that compress more than 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) when subjected to 50 pounds (23 kg) applied over 1 inch square (645 mm) of material and are greater than 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) in thickness in the uncompressed state shall not extend beneath walls, partitions or columns, which are fastened to the floor.

SECTION R602 WOOD WALL FRAMING

R602.1 General

Wood and wood-based products used for load-supporting purposes shall conform to the applicable provisions of this section.

R602.1.1 Sawn lumber

Sawn lumber shall be identified by a grade mark of an accredited lumber grading or inspection agency and have design values certified by an accreditation body that complies with DOC PS 20. In lieu of a grade mark, a certification of inspection issued by a lumber grading or inspection agency meeting the requirements of this section shall be accepted.

Note: See Section R301.1.1.1 for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings.

R602.1.2 End-jointed lumber

Approved end-jointed lumber identified by a grade mark conforming to Section R602.1 shall be permitted to be used interchangeably with solid-sawn members of the same species and grade. End-jointed lumber used in an assembly required elsewhere in this code to have a fire-resistance rating shall have the designation “Heat Resistant Adhesive” or “HRA” included in its grade mark.

R602.1.3 Structural glued-laminated timbers

Glued-laminated timbers shall be manufactured and identified as required in ANSI A190.1, ANSI 117 and ASTM D3737.

Particleboard shall conform to ANSI A208.1. Particleboard shall be identified by the grade mark or certificate of inspection issued by an approved agency.

R602.1.10 Fiberboard

Fiberboard shall conform to ASTM C208. Fiberboard sheathing, where used structurally, shall be identified by an approved agency as conforming to ASTM C208.

R602.1.11 Structural insulated panels

Structural insulated panels shall be manufactured and identified in accordance with ANSI/APA PRS 610.1.

R602.2 Grade

Studs shall be a minimum No. 3, standard or stud grade lumber.

Exception: Bearing studs not supporting floors and nonbearing studs shall be permitted to be utility grade lumber, provided that the studs are spaced in accordance with Table R602.3(5).

R602.3 Design and construction

Exterior walls of wood-frame construction shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and Figures R602.3(1) and R602.3(2), or in accordance with AWC NDS. Components of exterior walls shall be fastened in accordance with Tables R602.3(1) through R602.3(4). Wall sheathing shall be fastened directly to framing members and, where placed on the exterior side of an exterior wall, shall be capable of resisting the wind pressures listed in Table R301.2.1(1) adjusted for height and exposure using Table R301.2.1(2) and shall conform to the requirements of Table R602.3(3). Wall sheathing used only for exterior wall covering purposes shall comply with Section R703.

Studs shall be continuous from support at the sole plate to a support at the top plate to resist loads perpendicular to the wall. The support shall be a foundation or floor, ceiling or roof diaphragm or shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.

Exception: Jack studs, trimmer studs and cripple studs at openings in walls that comply with Tables R602.7(1) and R602.7(2).

d.Deflection criterion is L/240, where L is the height of the wall in inches from the exterior finish ground level to the top of the above-grade wall.

e.Interpolation is not permitted. For intermediate values of basic wind speed, heights of stem wall and above-grade wall, and design lateral soil load, use next higher value.

f.Where No. 4 reinforcing bars at a spacing of 48 inches are specified in the table as indicated by shaded cells, use of bars with a minimum yield strength of 40,000 psi or 60,000 psi is permitted.

g.Other than for No. 4 bars spaced at 48 inches on center, table values are based on reinforcing bars with a minimum yield strength of 60,000 psi. Maximum spacings shown are the values calculated for the specified bar size. In waffle and screen-grid walls where the bar used is Grade 60 and the size specified in the table, the actual spacing in the wall shall not exceed a whole-number multiple of 12 inches such as, 12, 24, 36 and 48, that is less than or equal to the tabulated spacing. Vertical reinforcement with a yield strength of less than 60,000 psi and bars of a different size than specified in the table are permitted in accordance with Section R608.5.4.7 and Table R608.5.4(2).

h.Height of stem wall is the distance from the exterior finish ground level to the top of the slab-on-ground.

i.Where the distance from the exterior finish ground level to the top of the slab-on-ground is equal to or greater than 4 feet, the stem wall shall be laterally supported at the top and bottom before backfilling. Where the wall is designed and constructed to be continuous with the above-grade wall, temporary supports bracing the top of the stem wall shall remain in place until the above-grade wall is laterally supported at the top by floor or roof construction.

j.See Table R608.3 for tolerances on nominal thicknesses, and minimum core dimensions and maximum spacing of horizontal and vertical cores for waffle-and screen-grid walls.

k.Tabulated values are applicable to construction where gravity loads bear on top of wall, and conditions where gravity loads from floor construction are transferred to wall from a wood ledger or cold-formed steel track bolted to side of wall. See Tables R608.6(1), R608.6(2) and R608.6(3).

R608.6.1 General.

The minimum thickness of load-bearing and nonload-bearing above-grade walls and reinforcement shall be as set forth in the appropriate table in this section based on the type of wall form to be used. The wall shall be designed in accordance with ACI 318 where the wall or building is not within the limitations of Section R608.2, where design is required by the tables in this section or where the wall is not within the scope of the tables in this section.

Above-grade concrete walls shall be constructed in accordance with this section and Figure R608.6(1), R608.6(2), R608.6(3) or R608.6(4). Above-grade concrete walls that are continuous with stem walls and not laterally supported by the slab-on-ground shall be designed and constructed in accordance with this section. Concrete walls shall be supported on continuous foundation walls or slabs-on-ground that are monolithic with the footing in accordance with Section R403. The minimum length of solid wall without openings shall be in accordance with Section R608.7. Reinforcement around openings, including lintels, shall be in accordance with Section R608.8. Lateral support for above-grade walls in the out-of-plane direction shall be provided by connections to the floor framing system, if applicable, and to ceiling and roof framing systems in accordance with Section R608.9. The wall thickness shall be equal to or greater than the thickness of the wall in the story above.

R608.6.2 Wall reinforcement for wind.

Vertical wall reinforcement for resistance to out-of-plane wind forces shall be determined from Table R608.6(1), R608.6(2), R608.6(3) or R608.6(4). For the design of nonload-bearing walls, in Tables R608.6(1), R608.6(2) and R608.6(3) use the appropriate column labeled “Top.” (see Sections R608.7.2.2.2 and R608.7.2.2.3). There shall be a vertical bar at corners of exterior walls. Unless more horizontal reinforcement is required by Section R608.7.2.2.1, the minimum horizontal reinforcement shall be four No. 4 bars [Grade 40 (280 MPa)] placed as follows: top bar within 12 inches (305 mm) of the top of the wall, bottom bar within 12 inches (305 mm) of the finish floor and one bar each at approximately one-third and two-thirds of the wall height.

R608.6.3 Continuity of wall reinforcement between stories.

Vertical reinforcement required by this section shall be continuous between elements providing lateral support for the wall. Reinforcement in the wall of the story above shall be continuous with the reinforcement in the wall of the story below, or the foundation wall, if applicable. Lap splices, where required, shall comply with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1). Where the above-grade wall is supported by a monolithic slab-on-ground and footing, dowel bars with a size and spacing to match the vertical above-grade concrete wall reinforcement shall be embedded in the monolithic slab-on-ground and footing the distance required to develop the dowel bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2) and lap-spliced with the above-grade wall reinforcement in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1).

Where a construction joint in the wall is located below the level of the floor and less than the distance required to develop the bar in tension, the distance required to develop the bar in tension shall be measured from the top of the concrete below the joint. See Section R608.5.5.

Exception: Where reinforcement in the wall above cannot be made continuous with the reinforcement in the wall below, the bottom of the reinforcement in the wall above shall be terminated in accordance with one of the following:

1. Extend below the top of the floor the distance required to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2).

2. Lap-spliced in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1) with a dowel bar that extends into the wall below the distance required to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2).

R608.6.4 Termination of reinforcement.

Where indicated in Items 1 through 3, vertical wall reinforcement in the top-most story with concrete walls shall be terminated with a 90-degree (1.57 rad) standard hook complying with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3).

1. Vertical bars adjacent to door and window openings required by Section R608.8.1.2.

2. Vertical bars at the ends of required solid wall segments (see Section R608.7.2.2.2).

3. Vertical bars (other than end bars, see Item 2) used as shear reinforcement in required solid wall segments where the reduction factor for design strength, R3, used is based on the wall having horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement (see Section R608.7.2.2.3).

The bar extension of the hook shall be oriented parallel to the horizontal wall reinforcement and be within 4 inches (102 mm) of the top of the wall.

Horizontal reinforcement shall be continuous around the building corners by bending one of the bars and lap-splicing it with the bar in the other wall in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1).

In required solid wall segments where the reduction factor for design strength, R3, is based on the wall having horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement in accordance with Section R608.7.2.2.1, horizontal wall reinforcement shall be terminated with a standard hook complying with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3) or in a lap-splice, except at corners where the reinforcement shall be continuous as required.

Exception: In lieu of bending horizontal reinforcement at corners, separate bent reinforcing bars shall be permitted provided that the bent bar is lap-spliced with the horizontal reinforcement in both walls in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1).

R608.6.5 Location of reinforcement in wall.

Except for vertical reinforcement at the ends of required solid wall segments, which shall be located as required by Section R608.7.2.2.2, the location of the vertical reinforcement shall not vary from the center of the wall by more than the greater of 10 percent of the wall thickness and 3/8-inch (10 mm). Horizontal and vertical reinforcement shall be located to provide not less than the minimum cover required by Section R608.5.4.1.

R608.7 Solid walls for resistance to lateral forces.

R608.7.1 Length of solid wall.

Each exterior wall line in each story shall have a total length of solid wall required by Section R608.7.1.1. A solid wall is a section of flat, waffle-grid or screen-grid wall, extending the full story height without openings or penetrations, except those permitted by Section R608.7.2. Solid wall segments that contribute to the total length of solid wall shall comply with Section R608.7.2.

R608.7.1.1 Length of solid wall for wind.

Buildings shall have solid walls in each exterior endwall line (the side of a building that is parallel to the span of the roof or floor framing) and sidewall line (the side of a building that is perpendicular to the span of the roof or floor framing) to resist lateral in-plane wind forces. The siteappropriate basic wind speed and exposure category shall be used in Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3) to determine the unreduced total length, UR, of solid wall required in each exterior endwall line and sidewall line. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet (10 668 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3) are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R1, from Table R608.7.1.1(4); however, reduced values shall be not less than the minimum values in Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3). Where the floor-to-ceiling height of a story is less than 10 feet (3048 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3), including minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R2, from Table R608.7.1.1(5). To account for different design strengths than assumed in determining the values in Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3), the unreduced lengths determined from Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3), including minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6). The reductions permitted by Tables R608.7.1.1(4), R608.7.1.1(5) and R608.7.1.1(6) are cumulative.

The total length of solid wall segments, TL, in a wall line that comply with the minimum length requirements of Section R608.7.2.1 [see Figure R608.7.1.1(1)] shall be equal to or greater than the product of the unreduced length of solid wall from Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3), UR and the applicable reduction factors, if any, from Tables R608.7.1.1(4), R608.7.1.1(5) and R608.7.1.1(6) as indicated by Equation R6-1.

where:

TL = Total length of solid wall segments in a wall line that comply with Section R608.7.2.1 [see Figure R608.7.1.1(1)].

R1 = 1.0 or reduction factor for mean roof height from Table R608.7.1.1(4).

R2 = 1.0 or reduction factor for floor-to-ceiling wall height from Table R608.7.1.1(5).

R3 = 1.0 or reduction factor for design strength from Table R608.7.1.1(6).

UR = Unreduced length of solid wall from Tables R608.7.1.1(1) through (3).

The total length of solid wall in a wall line, TL, shall be not less than that provided by two solid wall segments complying with the minimum length requirements of Section R608.7.2.1.

To facilitate determining the required wall thickness, wall type, number and grade of vertical bars at each end of each solid wall segment, and whether shear reinforcement is required, use of Equation R6-2 is permitted.

After determining the maximum permitted value of the reduction factor for design strength, R3, in accordance with Equation R6-2, select a wall type from Table R608.7.1.1(6) with R3 less than or equal to the value calculated.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 mile per hour = 0.447 m/s, 1 pound-force per linear foot = 0.146 kN/m, 1 pound per square foot = 47.88 Pa.

a.Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 28.4-1 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet, topographic factor, Kzt, equal to 1.0, and Risk Category II. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the unreduced length, UR, of solid wall length required in each endwall. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building.

b.Tabulated lengths in the “minimum” column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the “minimum” value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1.

c.For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R608.7.1.1(4). The reduced length shall be not less than the “minimum” value shown in the table.

d. Tabulated lengths for “one story or top story of two story” are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for “first story of two story” are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or Table R608.1.1(2) or (3), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7.1.1(5).

e.Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from  Table R608.7.1.1(6).

f.The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Tables R608.7.1.1(4), R608.7.1.1(5), and R608.7.1.1(6), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid wall segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively.

g.For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.

b.Tabulated lengths in the “minimum” column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the “minimum” value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1.

c.For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from
Table R608.7.1.1(4). The reduced length shall be not less than the “minimum” value shown in the table.

d.Tabulated lengths for “one story or top story of two story” are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for “first story of two story” are
based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or
Table R608.7.1.1(1) or Table R608.7.1.1(2), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7.1.1(5).

e.Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6).

f.The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Table R608.7.1.1(4), Table R608.7.1.1(5), and Table R608.7.1.1(6), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid walls segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively.

g.For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.

R608.7.2 Solid wall segments.

Solid wall segments that contribute to the required length of solid wall shall comply with this section. Reinforcement shall be provided in accordance with Section R608.7.2.2 and Table R608.7.1.1(6). Solid wall segments shall extend the full story-height without openings, other than openings for the utilities and other building services passing through the wall. In flat walls and waffle-grid walls, such openings shall have an area of less than 30 square inches (19 355 mm2) without any dimension exceeding 61/4 inches (159 mm), and shall not be located within 6 inches (152 mm) of the side edges of the solid wall segment. In screen-grid walls, such openings shall be located in the portion of the solid wall segment between horizontal and vertical cores of concrete and opening size and location are not restricted provided there is not any concrete removed.

R608.7.2.1 Minimum length of solid wall segment and maximum spacing.

Only solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length shall be included in the total length of solid wall required by Section R608.7.1. In addition, not more than two solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length and less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length shall be included in the required total length of solid wall. The maximum clear opening width shall be 18 feet (5486 mm). See Figure R608.7.1.1(1).

R608.7.2.2 Reinforcement in solid wall segments.

R608.7.2.2.1 Horizontal shear reinforcement.

Where reduction factors for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6) based on horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement being provided are used, solid wall segments shall have horizontal reinforcement consisting of minimum No. 4 bars. Horizontal shear reinforcement shall be the same grade of steel required for the vertical reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments by Section R608.7.2.2.2.

The spacing of horizontal reinforcement shall not exceed the smaller of one-half the length of the solid wall segment, minus 2 inches (51 mm), and 18 inches (457 mm). Horizontal shear reinforcement shall terminate in accordance with Section R608.6.4.

R608.7.2.2.2 Vertical reinforcement.

Vertical reinforcement applicable to the reduction factor(s) for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6) that is used, shall be located at each end of each solid wall segment in accordance with the applicable detail in Figure R608.7.1.1(2). The No. 4 vertical bar required on each side of an opening by Section R608.8.1.2 is permitted to be used as reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments where installed in accordance with the applicable detail in Figure R608.7.1.1(2). There shall be not less than two No. 4 bars at each end of solid wall segments located as required by the applicable detail in Figure R608.7.1.1(2). One of the bars at each end of solid wall segments shall be deemed to meet the requirements for vertical wall reinforcement required by Section R608.6.

The vertical wall reinforcement at each end of each solid wall segment shall be developed below the bottom of the adjacent wall opening [see Figure R608.7.1.1(3)] by one of the following methods:

1. Where the wall height below the bottom of the adjacent opening is equal to or greater than 22 inches (559 mm) for No. 4 or 28 inches (711 mm) for No. 5 vertical wall reinforcement, reinforcement around openings in accordance with Section R608.8.1 shall be sufficient.

2. Where the wall height below the bottom of the adjacent opening is less than required by Item 1, the vertical wall reinforcement adjacent to the opening shall extend into the footing far enough to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2), or shall be lap-spliced with a dowel that is embedded in the footing far enough to develop the dowel-bar in tension.

R608.7.2.2.3 Vertical shear reinforcement.

Where reduction factors for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6) based on horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement being provided are used, solid wall segments shall have vertical reinforcement consisting of minimum No. 4 bars. Vertical shear reinforcement shall be the same grade of steel required by Section R608.7.2.2.2 for the vertical reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments. The spacing of vertical reinforcement throughout the length of the segment shall not exceed the smaller of one third the length of the segment, and 18 inches (457 mm). Vertical shear reinforcement shall be continuous between stories in accordance with Section R608.6.3, and shall terminate in accordance with Section R608.6.4. Vertical shear reinforcement required by this section is permitted to be used for vertical reinforcement required by Table R608.6(1), R608.6(2), R608.6(3) or R608.6(4), whichever is applicable.

R608.7.2.3 Solid wall segments at corners.

At all interior and exterior corners of exterior walls, a solid wall segment shall extend the full height of each wall story. The segment shall have the length required to develop the horizontal reinforcement above and below the adjacent opening in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4. For an exterior corner, the limiting dimension is measured on the outside of the wall, and for an interior corner the limiting dimension is measured on the inside of the wall. See Section R608.8.1. The length of a segment contributing to the required length of solid wall shall comply with Section R608.7.2.1.

The end of a solid wall segment complying with the minimum length requirements of Section R608.7.2.1 shall be located not more than 6 feet (1829 mm) from each corner.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 6.895 kPa, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa, Grade 40 = 280 MPa, Grade 60 = 420 MPa.

a.See Table R608.3 for tolerances permitted from nominal thickness.

b.Table values are based on concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 2,500 psi. See Note j.

c.Table values are based on uniform loading. See Section R608.8.2 for lintels supporting concentrated loads.

d.Deflection criterion is L/240, where L is the clear span of the lintel in inches, or 1/2-inch, whichever is less.

e.Linear interpolation is permitted between ground snow loads and between lintel depths.

f.DR indicates design required.

g.Lintel depth, D, is permitted to include the available height of wall located directly above the lintel, provided that the increased lintel depth spans the entire length of the lintel.

h.Stirrups shall be fabricated from reinforcing bars with the same yield strength as that used for the main longitudinal reinforcement.

i.Allowable clear span without stirrups applicable to all lintels of the same depth, D. Top and bottom reinforcement for lintels without stirrups shall be not less than the least amount of reinforcement required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups. All other spans require stirrups spaced at not more than d/2.

j.Where concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 3,000 psi is used, clear spans for lintels without stirrups shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.05. If the increased span exceeds the allowable clear span for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups, the top and bottom reinforcement shall be equal to or greater than that required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition that has an allowable clear span that is equal to or greater than that of the lintel without stirrups that has been increased.

k.Center distance, A, is the center portion of the clear span where stirrups are not required. This is applicable to all longitudinal bar sizes and steel yield strengths.

l.Where concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 3,000 psi is used, center distance, A, shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.10.

m.The maximum clear opening width between two solid wall segments shall be 18 feet. See Section R608.7.2.1. Lintel clear spans in the table greater than 18 feet are shown for interpolation and information only.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 6.895 kPa, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa, Grade 40 = 280 MPa, Grade 60 = 420 MPa.

Note: Top and bottom reinforcement for lintels without stirrups, as shown in shaded cells, shall be equal to or greater than that required for lintel of the same depth and loading condition that has an allowable clear span that is equal to or greater than that of the lintel without stirrups.

a.See Table R608.3 for tolerances permitted from nominal thickness.

b.Table values are based on concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 2,500 psi. See Note j.

c.Table values are based on uniform loading. See Section R608.8.2 for lintels supporting concentrated loads.

d.Deflection criterion is L/240, where L is the clear span of the lintel in inches, or 1/2 inch, whichever is less.

e.Linear interpolation is permitted between ground snow loads and between lintel depths.

f.DR indicates design required.

g.Lintel depth, D, is permitted to include the available height of wall located directly above the lintel, provided that the increased lintel depth spans the entire length of the lintel.

h.Stirrups shall be fabricated from reinforcing bars with the same yield strength as that used for the main longitudinal reinforcement.

i.Allowable clear span without stirrups applicable to all lintels of the same depth, D. Top and bottom reinforcement for lintels without stirrups shall be not less than the least amount of reinforcement required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups. All other spans require stirrups spaced at not more than d/2.

j.Where concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 3,000 psi is used, clear spans for lintels without stirrups shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.05. If the increased span exceeds the allowable clear span for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups, the top and bottom reinforcement shall be equal to or greater than that required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition that has an allowable clear span that is equal to or greater than that of the lintel without stirrups that has been increased.

k.Center distance, A, is the center portion of the clear span where stirrups are not required. This is applicable to all longitudinal bar sizes and steel yield strengths.

l.Where concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 3,000 psi is used, center distance, A, shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.10.

m.The maximum clear opening width between two solid wall segments shall be 18 feet. See Section R608.7.2.1. Lintel clear spans in the table greater than 18 feet are shown for interpolation and information only.

R608.8.2.1 Lintels designed for gravity load-bearing conditions.

Where a lintel will be subjected to gravity load conditions 1 through 5 of Table R608.8(1), the clear span of the lintel shall not exceed that permitted by Tables R608.8(2) through R608.8(8). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in flat walls shall be determined in accordance with Tables R608.8(2) through R608.8(5), and constructed in accordance with Figure R608.8(2). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in waffle-grid walls shall be determined in accordance with Tables R608.8(6) and R608.8(7), and constructed in accordance with Figure R608.8(3). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in screen-grid walls shall be determined in accordance with Table R608.8(8), and constructed in accordance with Figure R608.8(4).

Where required by the applicable table, No. 3 stirrups shall be installed in lintels at a maximum spacing of d/2 where d equals the depth of the lintel, D, less the cover of the concrete as shown in Figures R608.8(2) through R608.8(4). The smaller value of d computed for the top and bottom bar shall be used to determine the maximum stirrup spacing. Where stirrups are required in a lintel with a single bar or two bundled bars in the top and bottom, they shall be fabricated like the letter “c” or “s” with 135-degree (2.36 rad) standard hooks at each end that comply with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3) and installed as shown in Figures R608.8(2) through R608.8(4). Where two bars are required in the top and bottom of the lintel and the bars are not bundled, the bars shall be separated by not less than 1 inch (25 mm). The free end of the stirrups shall be fabricated with 90- or 135-degree (1.57 or 2.36 rad) standard hooks that comply with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3) and installed as shown in Figures R608.8(2) and R608.8(3). For flat, waffle-grid and screen-grid lintels, stirrups are not required in the center distance, A, portion of spans in accordance with Figure R608.8(1) and Tables R608.8(2) through R608.8(8). See Section R608.8.2.2, Item 5, for requirement for stirrups through out lintels with bundled bars.

R608.8.2.2 Bundled bars in lintels.

It is permitted to bundle two bars in contact with each other in lintels if all of the following are observed:

1. Bars equal to or less than No. 6 are bundled.

2. Where the wall thickness is not sufficient to provide not less than 3 inches (76 mm) of clear space beside bars (total on both sides) oriented horizontally in a bundle, the bundled bars shall be oriented in a vertical plane.

3. Where vertically oriented bundled bars terminate with standard hooks to develop the bars in tension beyond the support (see Section R608.5.4.4), the hook extensions shall be staggered to provide not less than 1 inch (25 mm) clear spacing between the extensions.

4. Bundled bars shall not be lap spliced within the lintel span and the length on each end of the lintel that is required to develop the bars in tension.

5. Bundled bars shall be enclosed within stirrups throughout the length of the lintel. Stirrups and the installation thereof shall comply with Section R608.8.2.1.

R608.8.2.3 Lintels without stirrups designed for nonload-bearing conditions.

The maximum clear span of lintels without stirrups designed for nonload-bearing conditions of Table R608.8(1) shall be determined in accordance with this section. The maximum clear span of lintels without stirrups in flat walls shall be determined in accordance with Table R608.8(9), and the maximum clear span of lintels without stirrups in walls of waffle-grid or screen-grid construction shall be determined in accordance with Table R608.8(10).

R608.9 Requirements for connections—general.

Concrete walls shall be connected to footings, floors, ceilings and roofs in accordance with this section.

For SI: 1 mil = 0.0254 mm, 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound-force = 4.448 N.
