APPENDIX AU COB CONSTRUCTION (MONOLITHIC ADOBE)

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

User note:

About this appendix: Cob construction has been used for thousands of years around the world, notably in England and Northern Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, China and the Southwestern United States. An estimated 20,000 cob homes are still inhabited in the English county of Devon alone, some dating from the 15th century. The term “cob” derives from an Old English word for “lump,” since historical structures were often constructed one handful at a time.

SECTION AU101 GENERAL

AU101.1 Scope.

This appendix provides prescriptive and performance-based requirements for the use of natural cob as a building material. Buildings using cob walls shall comply with this code except as otherwise stated in this appendix.

AU101.2 Intent.

In addition to the intent described in Section R101.3, the purpose of this appendix is to establish minimum requirements for cob structures that provide flexibility in the application of certain provisions of the code, to permit the use of site-sourced and local materials, and to permit combinations of historical and modern techniques.

AU101.3 Tests and empirical evidence.

Tests for an alternative material, design or method of construction shall be in accordance with Section R104.11.1, and the building official shall have the authority to consider evidence of a history of successful use in lieu of testing.

AU101.4 Cob wall systems.

Cob wall systems include those shown in Figure AU101.4 and approved variations.

2.A braced wall panel not more than 30 degrees to an orthogonal braced wall line shall contribute 65 percent of its length to that line.

3.A braced wall panel greater than 45 degrees and not more than 60 degrees to an orthogonal braced wall line shall contribute 35 percent of its length to that line.

4.The angle of a curved braced wall panel to a braced wall line shall be determined with the chord of that section of wall, connecting the end points of the arc at the center of the wall.

AU106.11.2 Braced wall lines for buildings with curved walls.

Buildings with curved cob walls shall contain two braced wall lines in two orthogonal directions. The spacing of the braced wall lines for wind design in Table AU106.11(2) and the spacing and length of the braced wall lines for seismic design in Tables AU106.11(3), AU106.11(4) and AU106.11(5) shall be the maximum widths of the building in the two orthogonal directions.

AU106.11.3 Radius, thickness and length of curved braced wall panels.

Cob curved braced wall panels shall have an inside radius of not less than 5 feet (1524 mm), shall be of the thickness required in Table AU106.11(1) and of the length determined in accordance with Section AU106.11. The length of the curved wall shall be considered to be the length of the arc at the center of the wall, in accordance with Figure AU106.11.3 and determined by Equation AU-4.

ARCC = Length of arc at center of wall (in feet).

RC = Radius at center of wall = Ri + 0.5T (in feet).

Ri =  Inside radius of wall (in feet).

T = Thickness of wall without finish (in feet).

A = Angle of extent of braced wall panel from the center of the arc (in degrees).

Cob buttresses that are intended to provide out-of-plane wall bracing or additional capacity for braced wall panels shall be in accordance with an approved engineered design.

SECTION AU107 COB FLOORS

AU107.1 Cob floors.

Cob floors supported by grade shall be in accordance with an approved specification. Straw shall not be required in the material mix.

SECTION AU108 FIRE RESISTANCE

AU108.1 Fire-resistance rating.

Cob walls are not fire-resistance rated.

AU108.2 Clearance to fireplaces and chimneys.

Cob walls or other cob surfaces shall not require clearance to fireplaces and chimneys, except where clearance to noncombustibles is required by the manufacturer’s instructions.

SECTION AU109 THERMAL PERFORMANCE

AU109.1 Thermal characteristics.

Cob walls shall be classified as mass walls in accordance with Section N1102.2.5 and shall meet the R-value requirements for mass walls in Table N1102.1.3.
