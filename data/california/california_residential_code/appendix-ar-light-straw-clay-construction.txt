APPENDIX AR LIGHT STRAW-CLAY CONSTRUCTION

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

User note:

About this appendix: While heavier forms of straw-clay construction have been used in various parts of the world for thousands of years, light forms of straw-clay construction began to appear in Europe in 1950 and in the United States in 1990. These lighter forms of straw-clay construction are intended as infill materials in nonload-bearing walls. The advantages of light straw-clay construction, such as regulated by Appendix AR, include thermal performance and low environmental impact.

SECTION AR101 GENERAL

AR101.1 Scope.

This appendix shall govern the use of light straw-clay as a nonbearing building material and wall infill system in Seismic Design Categories A and B. Use of light straw-clay in Seismic Design Categories C, D0, D1 and D2 shall require an approved engineered design by a registered design professional in accordance with Section R301.1.3.

SECTION AR102 DEFINITIONS

AR102.1 General.

The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this appendix, have the meanings shown herein. Refer to Chapter 2 for general definitions.

CLAY. Inorganic soil with particle sizes of less than 0.00008 inch (0.002 mm) having the characteristics of high to very high dry strength and medium to high plasticity.

CLAY SLIP. A suspension of clay or clay subsoil particles in water.

CLAY SUBSOIL. Subsoil sourced directly from the earth or refined, containing clay and not more than trace amounts organic matter.

INFILL. Light straw-clay that is placed between the structural and nonstructural members of a building.

LIGHT STRAW-CLAY. A mixture of straw and clay slip compacted and dried to form insulation and plaster substrate between or around structural and nonstructural members in a wall.
