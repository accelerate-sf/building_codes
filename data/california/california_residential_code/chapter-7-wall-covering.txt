CHAPTER 7 WALL COVERING

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 7 establishes the various types of materials, materials standards and methods of application permitted as interior and exterior wall coverings. Interior coverings include interior plaster, gypsum board, ceramic tile, wood veneer paneling, hardboard paneling, wood shakes and wood shingles. Exterior wall coverings regulated by this section include aluminum, stone and masonry veneer, wood, hardboard, particleboard, wood structural panel siding, wood shakes and shingles, exterior plaster, steel, vinyl, fiber cement and exterior insulation finish systems. This chapter also contains requirements for the use of vapor retarders for moisture control in walls; wind resistance and water-resistive barriers for exterior wall coverings; and the water-resistive barrier required beneath exterior materials.

SECTION R701 GENERAL

R701.1 Application

The provisions of this chapter shall control the design and construction of the interior and exterior wall covering for buildings.

Exception: Log walls designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of ICC 400.

R703.1.1 Water resistance

The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in a manner that prevents the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a water-resistant barrier behind the exterior cladding as required by Section R703.2 and a means of draining to the exterior water that penetrates the exterior cladding.

Exceptions:

1.A weather-resistant exterior wall envelope shall not be required over concrete or masonry walls designed in accordance with Chapter 6 and flashed in accordance with Section R703.4 or R703.8.

2.Compliance with the requirements for a means of drainage, and the requirements of Sections R703.2 and R703.4, shall not be required for an exterior wall envelope that has been demonstrated to resist wind-driven rain through testing of the exterior wall envelope, including joints, penetrations and intersections with dissimilar materials, in accordance with ASTM E331 under the following conditions:

2.1.Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall include at least one opening, one control joint, one wall/eave interface and one wall sill. All tested openings and penetrations shall be representative of the intended end-use configuration.

2.2.Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall be at least 4 feet by 8 feet (1219 mm by 2438 mm) in size.

2.3.Exterior wall assemblies shall be tested at a minimum differential pressure of 6.24 pounds per square foot (299 Pa).

2.4.Exterior wall envelope assemblies shall be subjected to the minimum test exposure for a minimum of 2 hours.

The exterior wall envelope design shall be considered to resist wind-driven rain where the results of testing indicate that water did not penetrate control joints in the exterior wall envelope, joints at the perimeter of openings penetration or intersections of terminations with dissimilar materials.

R703.1.2 Wind resistance

Wall coverings, backing materials and their attachments shall be capable of resisting wind loads in accordance with Tables R301.2.1(1) and R301.2.1(2). Wind-pressure resistance of the siding, soffit and backing materials shall be determined by ASTM E330 or other applicable standard test methods. Where wind-pressure resistance is determined by design analysis, data from approved design standards and analysis conforming to generally accepted engineering practice shall be used to evaluate the siding, soffit and backing material and its fastening. All applicable failure modes including bending rupture of siding, fastener withdrawal and fastener head pull-through shall be considered in the testing or design analysis. Where the wall covering, soffit and backing material resist wind load as an assembly, use of the design capacity of the assembly shall be permitted.

R703.2 Water-resistive barrier.

Not fewer than one layer of water-resistive barrier shall be applied over studs or sheathing of all exterior walls with flashing as indicated in Section R703.4, in such a manner as to provide a continuous water-resistive barrier behind the exterior wall veneer. The water-resistive barrier material shall be continuous to the top of walls and terminated at penetrations and building appendages in a manner to meet the requirements of the exterior wall envelope as described in Section R703.1. Water-resistive barrier materials shall comply with one of the following:

1. No. 15 felt complying with ASTM D226, Type 1.

2. ASTM E2556, Type 1 or 2.

3. ASTM E331 in accordance with Section R703.1.1.

4. Other approved materials in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.

R703.3 Wall covering nominal thickness and attachments.

The nominal thickness and attachment of exterior wall coverings shall be in accordance with Table R703.3(1), the wall covering material requirements of this section, and the wall covering manufacturer’s installation instructions. Cladding attachment over foam sheathing shall comply with the additional requirements and limitations of Sections R703.15 through R703.17. Nominal material thicknesses in Table R703.3(1) are based on a maximum stud spacing of 16 inches (406 mm) on center. Where specified by the siding manufacturer’s instructions and supported by a test report or other documentation, attachment to studs with greater spacing is permitted. Fasteners for exterior wall coverings attached to wood framing shall be in accordance with Section R703.3.3 and Table R703.3(1). Exterior wall coverings shall be attached to cold-formed steel light frame construction in accordance with the cladding manufacturer’s installation instructions, the requirements of Table R703.3(1) using screw fasteners substituted for the nails specified in accordance with Table R703.3(2), or an approved design.
