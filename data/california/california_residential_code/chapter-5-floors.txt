CHAPTER 5 FLOORS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 5 provides the requirements for the design and construction of floor systems that will be capable of supporting minimum required design loads. This chapter covers wood floor framing, wood floors on the ground, cold-formed steel floor framing and concrete slabs on the ground. Allowable span tables are provided that greatly simplify the determination of joist, girder and sheathing sizes for raised floor systems of wood framing and cold-formed steel framing. This chapter also contains prescriptive requirements for wood-framed exterior decks and their attachment to the main building.

SECTION R501 GENERAL

R501.1 Application

The provisions of this chapter shall control the design and construction of the floors for buildings, including the floors of attic spaces used to house mechanical or plumbing fixtures and equipment.

R501.2 Requirements

Floor construction shall be capable of accommodating all loads in accordance with Section R301 and of transmitting the resulting loads to the supporting structural elements.

SECTION R502 WOOD FLOOR FRAMING

R502.1 General

Wood and wood-based products used for load-supporting purposes shall conform to the applicable provisions of this section.

R502.1.1 Sawn lumber

Sawn lumber shall be identified by a grade mark of an accredited lumber grading or inspection agency and have design values certified by an accreditation body that complies with DOC PS 20. In lieu of a grade mark, a certificate of inspection issued by a lumber grading or inspection agency meeting the requirements of this section shall be accepted.

Note: See Section R301.1.1.1 for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings.

R502.1.1.1 Preservative-treated lumber

Preservative treated dimension lumber shall be identified as required by Section R317.2.

R502.1.1.2 End-jointed lumber

Approved end-jointed lumber identified by a grade mark conforming to Section R502.1.1 shall be permitted to be used interchangeably with solid-sawn members of the same species and grade. End-jointed lumber used in an assembly required elsewhere in this code to have a fire-resistance rating shall have the designation “Heat-Resistant Adhesive” or “HRA” included in its grade mark.

R502.1.2 Prefabricated wood I-joists

Structural capacities and design provisions for prefabricated wood I-joists shall be established and monitored in accordance with ASTM D5055.

R502.1.3 Structural glued laminated timbers

Glued laminated timbers shall be manufactured and identified as required in ANSI A190.1, ANSI 117 and ASTM D3737.

R502.1.4 Structural log members

Structural log members shall comply with the provisions of ICC 400.

R502.1.5 Structural composite lumber

Structural capacities for structural composite lumber shall be established and monitored in accordance with ASTM D5456.

R502.1.6 Cross-laminated timber

Cross-laminated timber shall be manufactured and identified as required by ANSI/APA PRG 320.

R502.1.7 Engineered wood rim board

Engineered wood rim boards shall conform to ANSI/APA PRR 410 or shall be evaluated in accordance with ASTM D7672. Structural capacities shall be in accordance with ANSI/APA PRR 410 or established in accordance with ASTM D7672. Rim boards conforming to ANSI/APA PRR 410 shall be marked in accordance with that standard.

R502.2 Design and construction

Floors shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, Figure R502.2 and Sections R317 and R318 or in accordance with ANSI AWC NDS.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

FIGURE R502.2

FLOOR CONSTRUCTION

R502.2.1 Framing at braced wall lines

A load path for lateral forces shall be provided between floor framing and braced wall panels located above or below a floor, as specified in Section R602.10.8.

R502.2.2 Blocking and subflooring

Blocking for fastening panel edges or fixtures shall be not less than utility grade lumber. Subflooring shall be not less than utility grade lumber, No. 4 common grade boards or wood structural panels as specified in Section R503.2. Fireblocking shall be of any grade lumber.

R502.3 Allowable joist spans

Spans for floor joists shall be in accordance with Tables R502.3.1(1) and R502.3.1(2). For other grades and species and for other loading conditions, refer to the AWC STJR.

R502.3.1 Sleeping areas and attic joists

Table R502.3.1(1) shall be used to determine the maximum allowable span of floor joists that support sleeping areas and attics that are accessed by means of a fixed stairway in accordance with Section R311.7 provided that the design live load does not exceed 30 pounds per square foot (1.44 kPa) and the design dead load does not exceed 20 pounds per square foot (0.96 kPa). The allowable span of ceiling joists that support attics used for limited storage or no storage shall be determined in accordance with Section R802.5.

Joists bearing on top of a multiple-ply beam or ledger shall be fastened in accordance with Table R602.3(1). Joists bearing on top of a single-ply beam or ledger shall be attached by a mechanical connector. Joist framing into the side of a beam or ledger board shall be supported by approved joist hangers.

Joist ends and bearing locations shall be provided with lateral resistance to prevent rotation. Where lateral restraint is provided by joist hangers or blocking between joists, their depth shall equal not less than 60 percent of the joist depth. Where lateral restraint is provided by rim joists, they shall be secured to the end of each joist with not fewer than three 10d (3-inch by 0.128-inch) (76 mm by 3.3 mm) nails or three No. 10 x 3-inch-long (76 mm) wood screws.

c. Individual wood deck boards supported by two joists shall be considered single span and three or more joists shall be considered multiple span.

R507.8 Vertical and lateral supports

Where supported by attachment to an exterior wall, decks shall be positively anchored to the primary structure and designed for both vertical and lateral loads. Such attachment shall not be accomplished by the use of toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. For decks with cantilevered framing members, connection to exterior walls or other framing members shall be designed and constructed to resist uplift resulting from the full live load specified in Table R301.5 acting on the cantilevered portion of the deck. Where positive connection to the primary building structure cannot be verified during inspection, decks shall be self-supporting.

R507.9 Vertical and lateral supports at band joist

Vertical and lateral supports for decks shall comply with this section.

R507.9.1 Vertical supports

Vertical loads shall be transferred to band joists with ledgers in accordance with this section.

R507.9.1.1 Ledger details

Deck ledgers shall be a minimum 2-inch by 8-inch (51 mm by 203 mm) nominal, pressure-preservative-treated Southern pine, incised pressure-preservative-treated hem-fir, or approved, naturally durable, No. 2 grade or better lumber.

R507.10 Exterior guards.

Guards shall be constructed to meet the requirements of Sections R301.5 and R312, and this section.

R507.10.1 Support of guards.

Where guards are supported on deck framing, guard loads shall be transferred to the deck framing with a continuous load path to the deck joists.

R507.10.1.1 Guards supported by side of deck framing.

Where guards are connected to the interior or exterior side of a deck joist or beam, the joist or beam shall be connected to the adjacent joists to prevent rotation of the joist or beam. Connections relying only on fasteners in end grain withdrawal are not permitted.

R507.10.1.2 Guards supported on top of deck framing.

Where guards are mounted on top of the decking, the guards shall be connected to the deck framing or blocking and installed in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions to transfer the guard loads to the adjacent joists.

R507.10.2 Wood posts at deck guards.

Where 4-inch by 4-inch (102 mm by 102 mm) wood posts support guard loads applied to the top of the guard, such posts shall not be notched at the connection to the supporting structure.

R507.10.3 Plastic composite guards.

Plastic composite
guards shall comply with the provisions of Section R507.2.2.

R507.10.4 Other guards.

Other guards shall be in accordance with either manufacturer’s instructions or accepted engineering principles.
