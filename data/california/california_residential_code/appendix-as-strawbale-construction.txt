APPENDIX AS STRAWBALE CONSTRUCTION

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Note: The IECC climate zones used by this section differ from those used by the California Energy Code to determine applicability of energy efficiency measures. Comparison of IECC and California Energy Code climate zones is shown in Table R702.7(5).

User note:

About this appendix: The use of strawbale construction has steadily increased since the 1980s such that there are now buildings of strawbale construction in every state in the United States and in more than 50 countries around the globe. Estimates are that there are over 1,000 buildings of strawbale construction in California alone, including both residential and commercial buildings. Appendix AS provides prescriptive requirements for the construction of exterior and interior walls, both structural and nonstructural, in buildings that are under the scope of this code.

SECTION AS101 GENERAL

AS101.1 Scope.

This appendix provides prescriptive and performance-based requirements for the use of baled straw as a building material. Other methods of strawbale construction shall be subject to approval in accordance with Section R104.11 of this code. Buildings using strawbale walls shall comply with this code except as otherwise stated in this appendix.

AS101.2 Strawbale wall systems.

Strawbale wall systems include those shown in Figure AS101.2 and approved variations.

Note: See Figures AS105.1(1) through AS105.1(4) for detailed views and section references. Other strawbale wall systems or variations are permitted as approved.
