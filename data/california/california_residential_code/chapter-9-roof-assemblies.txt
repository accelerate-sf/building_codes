3. Metal panel, metal shingle and concrete and clay tile roof coverings shall be permitted to be installed over existing wood shake roofs where applied in accordance with Section R908.4.

4. The application of a new protective roof coating over an existing protective roof coating, metal roof panel, metal roof shingle, mineral surfaced roll roofing, built-up roof, modified bitumen roofing, thermoset and thermoplastic single-ply roofing and spray polyurethane foam roofing system shall be permitted without tear-off of existing roof coverings.

R908.3.1.1 Roof recover not allowed.

A roof recover shall not be permitted where any of the following conditions occur:

1. Where the existing roof or roof covering is water soaked or has deteriorated to the point that the existing roof or roof covering is not adequate as a base for additional roofing.
