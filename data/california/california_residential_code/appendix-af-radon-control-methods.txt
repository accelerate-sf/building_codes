APPENDIX AF RADON CONTROL METHODS

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically adopted by a state agency or referenced in the adopting ordinance.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix AF contains provisions that are intended to mitigate the transfer of radon gases from the soil into dwelling units. Radon is a radioactive gas that has been identified as a cancer-causing agent. Radon comes from the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water.

SECTION AF101 SCOPE

AF101.1 General.

This appendix contains requirements for new construction in jurisdictions where radon-resistant construction is required.

Inclusion of this appendix by jurisdictions shall be determined through the use of locally available data or determination of Zone 1 designation in Figure AF101.1 and Table AF101.1.

a. pCi/L stands for picocuries per liter of radon gas. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that homes that measure 4 pCi/L and greater be mitigated.

The EPA and the US Geological Survey have evaluated the radon potential in the United States and have developed a map of radon zones designed to assist building officials in deciding whether radonresistant features are applicable in new construction.

The map assigns each of the 3,141 counties in the United States to one of three zones based on radon potential. Each zone designation reflects the average short-term radon measurement that can be expected to be measured in a building without the implementation of radon-control methods. The radon zone designation of highest priority is Zone 1. Table AF101.1 lists the Zone 1 counties illustrated on the map. More detailed information can be obtained from state-specific booklets (EPA-401-R-93-021 through 070) available through the State Radon Offices or from the EPA Regional Offices.

SECTION AF102 DEFINITIONS

AF102.1 General.

For the purpose of these requirements, the terms used shall be defined as follows:

DRAIN TILE LOOP. A continuous length of drain tile or perforated pipe extending around all or part of the internal or external perimeter of a basement or crawl space footing.

RADON GAS. A naturally occurring, chemically inert, radioactive gas that is not detectable by human senses. As a gas, it can move readily through particles of soil and rock, and can accumulate under the slabs and foundations of homes where it can easily enter into the living space through construction cracks and openings.

SOIL-GAS-RETARDER. A continuous membrane of 6-mil (0.15 mm) polyethylene or other equivalent material used to retard the flow of soil gases into a building.

SUBMEMBRANE DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM. A system designed to achieve lower submembrane air pressure relative to crawl space air pressure by use of a vent drawing air from beneath the soil-gas-retarder membrane.

SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM (Active). A system designed to achieve lower subslab air pressure relative to indoor air pressure by use of a fan-powered vent drawing air from beneath the slab.

SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM (Passive). A system designed to achieve lower subslab air pressure relative to indoor air pressure by use of a vent pipe routed through the conditioned space of a building and connecting the subslab area with outdoor air, thereby relying on the convective flow of air upward in the vent to draw air from beneath the slab.

SECTION AF103 REQUIREMENTS

AF103.1 General.

The following construction techniques are intended to resist radon entry and prepare the building for post-construction radon mitigation, if necessary (see Figure AF103.1). These techniques are required in areas where designated by the jurisdiction.

FIGURE AF103.1

RADON-RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION DETAILS FOR FOUR FOUNDATION TYPES

AF103.2 Subfloor preparation.

A layer of gas-permeable material shall be placed under all concrete slabs and other floor systems that directly contact the ground and are within the walls of the living spaces of the building, to facilitate future installation of a subslab depressurization system, if needed. The gas-permeable layer shall consist of one of the following:

1. A uniform layer of clean aggregate, not less than 4 inches (102 mm) thick. The aggregate shall consist of material that will pass through a 2-inch (51 mm) sieve and be retained by a 1/4-inch (6.4 mm) sieve.

2. A uniform layer of sand (native or fill), not less than 4 inches (102 mm) thick, overlain by a layer or strips of geotextile drainage matting designed to allow the lateral flow of soil gases.

3. Other materials, systems or floor designs with demonstrated capability to permit depressurization across the entire subfloor area.

AF103.3 Soil-gas-retarder.

A minimum 6-mil (0.15 mm) [or 3-mil (0.075 mm) cross-laminated] polyethylene or equivalent flexible sheeting material shall be placed on top of the gas-permeable layer prior to casting the slab or placing the floor assembly to serve as a soil-gas-retarder by bridging any cracks that develop in the slab or floor assembly, and to prevent concrete from entering the void spaces in the aggregate base material. The sheeting shall cover the entire floor area with separate sections of sheeting lapped not less than 12 inches (305 mm). The sheeting shall fit closely around any pipe, wire or other penetrations of the material. Punctures or tears in the material shall be sealed or covered with additional sheeting.
